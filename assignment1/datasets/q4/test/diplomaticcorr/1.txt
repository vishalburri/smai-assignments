<s> _resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 resolution directing the publication and distribution of the journal and proceedings of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states <\s>
<s> _resolved_ by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the journal of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states now remaining in the office of the secretary of state and all acts and proceedings of that convention which are in possession of the government of the united states be published under the direction of the president of the united states together with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings and the foreign correspondence of the congress of the united states from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states in the year seventeen hundred and eightythree except such parts of the said foreign correspondence as the president of the united states may deem it improper at this time to publish <\s>
<s> and that one thousand copies thereof be printed of which one copy shall be furnished to each member of the present congress and the residue shall remain subject to the future disposition of congress <\s>
<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>

<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>

<s> _resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 resolution directing the publication and distribution of the journal and proceedings of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states <\s>
<s> _resolved_ by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the journal of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states now remaining in the office of the secretary of state and all acts and proceedings of that convention which are in possession of the government of the united states be published under the direction of the president of the united states together with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings and the foreign correspondence of the congress of the united states from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states in the year seventeen hundred and eightythree except such parts of the said foreign correspondence as the president of the united states may deem it improper at this time to publish <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>

<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>

<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>

<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>

<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>

<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>

<s> _resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 resolution directing the publication and distribution of the journal and proceedings of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states <\s>
<s> _resolved_ by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the journal of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states now remaining in the office of the secretary of state and all acts and proceedings of that convention which are in possession of the government of the united states be published under the direction of the president of the united states together with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings and the foreign correspondence of the congress of the united states from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states in the year seventeen hundred and eightythree except such parts of the said foreign correspondence as the president of the united states may deem it improper at this time to publish <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>

<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>

<s> _resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 resolution directing the publication and distribution of the journal and proceedings of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states <\s>
<s> _resolved_ by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the journal of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states now remaining in the office of the secretary of state and all acts and proceedings of that convention which are in possession of the government of the united states be published under the direction of the president of the united states together with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings and the foreign correspondence of the congress of the united states from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states in the year seventeen hundred and eightythree except such parts of the said foreign correspondence as the president of the united states may deem it improper at this time to publish <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>

<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>

<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>

<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>

<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>

<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>

<s> _resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 resolution directing the publication and distribution of the journal and proceedings of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states <\s>
<s> _resolved_ by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the journal of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states now remaining in the office of the secretary of state and all acts and proceedings of that convention which are in possession of the government of the united states be published under the direction of the president of the united states together with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings and the foreign correspondence of the congress of the united states from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states in the year seventeen hundred and eightythree except such parts of the said foreign correspondence as the president of the united states may deem it improper at this time to publish <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>

<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>

<s> _resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 resolution directing the publication and distribution of the journal and proceedings of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states <\s>
<s> _resolved_ by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the journal of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states now remaining in the office of the secretary of state and all acts and proceedings of that convention which are in possession of the government of the united states be published under the direction of the president of the united states together with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings and the foreign correspondence of the congress of the united states from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states in the year seventeen hundred and eightythree except such parts of the said foreign correspondence as the president of the united states may deem it improper at this time to publish <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>

<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>

<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>

<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>

<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>

<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>

<s> _resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 resolution directing the publication and distribution of the journal and proceedings of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states <\s>
<s> _resolved_ by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the journal of the convention which formed the present constitution of the united states now remaining in the office of the secretary of state and all acts and proceedings of that convention which are in possession of the government of the united states be published under the direction of the president of the united states together with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings and the foreign correspondence of the congress of the united states from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states in the year seventeen hundred and eightythree except such parts of the said foreign correspondence as the president of the united states may deem it improper at this time to publish <\s>

<s> approved march 27th 1818 advertisement <\s>
<s> the correspondence between the old congress and the american agents commissioners and ministers in foreign countries was secret and confidential during the whole revolution <\s>
<s> the letters as they arrived were read in congress and referred to the standing committee of foreign affairs accompanied with requisite instructions when necessary as to the nature and substance of the replies <\s>
<s> the papers embracing this correspondence which swelled to a considerable mass before the end of the revolution were removed to the department of state after the formation of the new government where they have remained ever since accessible to such persons as have wished to consult them for particular purposes but never before published <\s>
<s> in compliance with the resolution of congress of march 27th 1818 they are now laid before the public under the direction of the president of the united states <\s>
<s> on the 29th of november 1775 a committee of five was appointed to correspond with the friends of america in other countries <\s>
<s> it seems to have been the specific object of this committee to gain information in regard to the public feeling in great britain towards the colonies and also the degree of interest which was likely to be taken by other european powers in the contest then beginning to grow warm on this side of the atlantic <\s>
<s> certain commercial designs came also under its cognizance such as procuring ammunition arms soldiers clothing and other military stores from abroad <\s>
<s> a secret correspondence was immediately opened with arthur lee in london chiefly with the view of procuring intelligence <\s>
<s> early in the next year silas deane was sent to france by the committee with instructions to act as a commercial or political agent for the american colonies as circumstances might dictate <\s>
<s> this committee was denominated the _committee of secret correspondence and continued in operation till april 17th 1777 when the name was changed to that of the _committee of foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the duties and objects of the committee appear to have remained as before notwithstanding the change of name <\s>
<s> in the first years of the war it was customary for the commissioners and ministers abroad to address their letters to the committee or to the president of congress <\s>
<s> in either case the letters were read in congress and answered only by the committee this body being the organ of all communications from congress on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> the proceedings of congress in relation to these topics were recorded in a journal kept separately from that in which the records of other transactions were entered and called the _secret journal <\s>
<s> this journal has recently been published in conformity with the same resolution of congress which directed the publication of the foreign correspondence <\s>
<s> livingston was chosen secretary of foreign affairs on the 10th of august 1781 when the committee was dissolved and the foreign correspondence from that time went through the hands of the secretary <\s>
<s> as the responsibility thus devolved on a single individual instead of being divided among several the business of the department was afterwards executed with much more promptness and efficiency <\s>
<s> the plan adopted in arranging the papers for publication has been to bring together those of each commissioner or minister in strict chronological order <\s>
<s> as there is much looseness and sometimes confusion in their arrangement as preserved in the department of state this plan has not always been easy to execute <\s>
<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>

<s> the advantage of such a method however is so great the facility it affords for a ready reference and consultation is so desirable and the chain of events is thereby exhibited in a manner so much more connected and satisfactory that no pains have been spared to bring every letter and document into its place in the exact order of its date <\s>
<s> thus the correspondence of each commissioner or minister presents a continuous history of the acts in which he was concerned and of the events to which he alludes <\s>
<s> it will be seen that letters are occasionally missing <\s>
<s> these are not to be found in the archives of the government <\s>
<s> the loss may be accounted for in several ways <\s>
<s> in the first place the modes of conveyance were precarious and failures were frequent and unavoidable <\s>
<s> the despatches were sometimes intrusted to the captains of such american vessels merchantmen or privateers as happened to be in port and sometimes forwarded by regular express packets but in both cases they were subject to be captured <\s>
<s> moreover the despatches were ordered to be thrown overboard if the vessel conveying them should be pursued by an enemy or exposed to the hazard of being taken <\s>
<s> it thus happened that many letters never arrived at their destination although duplicates and triplicates were sent <\s>
<s> again the committee had no secretary to take charge of the papers and no regular place of deposit the members themselves were perpetually changing and each had equal access to the papers and was equally responsible for their safe keeping <\s>
<s> they were often in the hands of the secretary of congress and of other members who wished to consult them <\s>
<s> nor does it appear that copies were methodically taken till after the war <\s>
<s> in such a state of things many letters must necessarily have been withdrawn and lost <\s>
<s> when mr jay became secretary of foreign affairs in the year 1784 that office had been made the place of deposit for all the foreign correspondence which then remained <\s>
<s> under his direction a large portion of it was copied into volumes apparently with much care both in regard to the search after papers and the accuracy of the transcribers <\s>
<s> these volumes are still retained in the archives of the department of state together with such originals as have escaped the perils of accident and the negligence of their early keepers <\s>
<s> the letters of the committee of congress to the agents abroad were few scanty and meagre <\s>
<s> this may be ascribed to two causes <\s>
<s> first there was really very little to communicate which was not known through the public papers and secondly it was not made the duty of any particular member of the committee to write letters <\s>
<s> hence the agents frequently complained that their despatches were not answered and that they were embarrassed for want of intelligence <\s>
<s> when mr livingston came into the office of foreign affairs a salutary change took place in this respect <\s>
<s> his letters are numerous full and instructive <\s>
<s> in preparing the papers for the press according to the spirit of the resolution of congress the first rule has been to print such matter only as possesses some value either as containing historical facts or illustrating traits of character or developing the causes of prominent events <\s>
<s> in such a mass of materials so varied in their character and in the topics upon which they treat it has not always been easy to discriminate with precision in regard to these points <\s>
<s> the editor can only say that he has exercised his best judgment to accomplish the end proposed <\s>
<s> his task has been rendered still more perplexing from the disputes and even quarrels which existed between the early american commissioners and with the effects of which a large portion of their correspondence is tinged <\s>
<s> no worthy purpose can be answered by reviving the remembrance of these contentions at the present day but at the same time such particulars ought to be retained as will exhibit in their proper light the characters of the persons concerned and show how far their altercations operated to the public good or injury <\s>
<s> this line has been pursued as far as practicable and those parts of the correspondence chiefly marked with personalities and touching little on public interests have been omitted as neither suited to the dignity of the subject nor to the design of this publication <\s>
<s> on perusing these volumes it may at first seem extraordinary that so large a collection of letters written by different persons at different times embracing topics of great moment and assuming the character of secret and confidential despatches should be so generally well fitted to meet the public eye <\s>
<s> but it must be kept in mind that the writers knew their letters would be read in open congress which was much the same as publishing them and under this impression they were doubtless prompted to study circumspection both in matter and manner <\s>
<s> justice to himself requires the editor to observe that he has not felt at liberty in accordance with the express terms of the resolution of congress to add anything to the original papers by way of commentary or illustration <\s>
<s> the few notes which he has subjoined are intended mainly to assist the reader in referring to collateral topics in different parts of the work <\s>
<s> when it is considered under what circumstances and with what aims these letters were written it will be obvious that time and succeeding events must have detected occasional misapprehensions and errors of statement in the writers as well as the fallacy of some of their conjectures and speculations <\s>
<s> they were called upon to grapple with the politics of europe and to discourse on a theme and execute a task that would have been of no easy accomplishment in the hands of the veteran diplomatists of the old world <\s>
<s> the editor's researches in the public offices of england and france with particular reference to the early diplomatic relations between those countries and the united states have put in his possession a body of facts on the subjects discussed in these papers which might have been used to advantage in supplying corrections and explanations but for the reason above mentioned he has not deemed himself authorised to assume such a duty <\s>
<s> he is not without the expectation however that the public will hereafter be made acquainted with the results of his inquiries in some other form <\s>
