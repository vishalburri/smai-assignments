<s> pendennis had always been to be a gentleman <\s>
<s> it takes much time and careful saving for a provincial doctor whose gains are not very large to lay by enough money wherewith to purchase a house and land but besides our friend's own frugality and prudence fortune aided him considerably in his endeavour and brought him to the point which he so panted to attain <\s>
<s> he laid out some money very advantageously in the purchase of a house and small estate close upon the village of clavering before mentioned <\s>
<s> words cannot describe nor did he himself ever care to confess to any one his pride when he found himself a real landed proprietor and could walk over acres of which he was the master <\s>
<s> a lucky purchase which he had made of shares in a copper mine added very considerably to his wealth and he realised with great prudence while this mine was still at its full vogue <\s>
<s> finally he sold his business at bath to mr <\s>
<s> parkins for a handsome sum of ready money and for an annuity to be paid to him during a certain number of years after he had for ever retired from the handling of the mortar and pestle <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis his son was eight years old at the time of this event so that it is no wonder that the latter who left bath and the surgery so young should forget the existence of such a place almost entirely and that his father's hands had ever been dirtied by the compounding of odious pills or the preparation of filthy plasters <\s>
<s> the old man never spoke about the shop himself never alluded to it called in the medical practitioner of clavering to attend his family when occasion arrived sunk the black breeches and stockings altogether attended market and sessions and wore a bottle green coat and brass buttons with drab gaiters just as if he had been an english gentleman all his life <\s>

<s> it was he who founded the clavering book club and set up the samaritan soup and blanket society <\s>
<s> it was he who brought the mail which used to run through cacklefield before away from that village and through clavering <\s>
<s> at church he was equally active as a vestryman and a worshipper <\s>
<s> at market every thursday he went from pen to stall looked at samples of oats and munched corn felt beasts punched geese in the breast and weighed them with a knowing air and did business with the farmers at the clavering arms as well as the oldest frequenter of that house of call <\s>
<s> it was now his shame as it formerly was his pride to be called doctor and those who wished to please him always gave him the title of squire <\s>

<s> you could see by his wife's looks that she disbelieved in these genealogical legends for she generally endeavoured to turn the conversation when he commenced them <\s>
<s> but his little boy believed them to their fullest extent and roger pendennis of agincourt arthur pendennis of crecy general pendennis of blenheim and oudenarde were as real and actual beings for this young gentleman as whom shall we say as robinson crusoe or peter wilkins or the seven champions of christendom whose histories were in his library <\s>
<s> pendennis's fortune which at the best was not above eight hundred pounds a year did not with the best economy and management permit of his living with the great folks of the county but he had a decent comfortable society of the second best sort <\s>
