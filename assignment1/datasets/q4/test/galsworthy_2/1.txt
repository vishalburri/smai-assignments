<s> i remember he used to drink madeira but ask your aunt ann <\s>
<s> what was his father <\s>
<s> he er had to do with the land down in dorsetshire by the sea <\s>
<s> james once went down to see for himself what sort of place this was that they had come from <\s>
<s> he found two old farms with a cart track rutted into the pink earth leading down to a mill by the beach a little grey church with a buttressed outer wall and a smaller and greyer chapel <\s>
<s> the stream which worked the mill came bubbling down in a dozen rivulets and pigs were hunting round that estuary <\s>
<s> a haze hovered over the prospect <\s>
<s> down this hollow with their feet deep in the mud and their faces towards the sea it appeared that the primeval forsytes had been content to walk sunday after sunday for hundreds of years <\s>
<s> whether or no james had cherished hopes of an inheritance or of something rather distinguished to be found down there he came back to town in a poor way and went about with a pathetic attempt at making the best of a bad job <\s>
<s> there's very little to be had out of that he said regular country little place old as the hills .... <\s>
<s> its age was felt to be a comfort <\s>
<s> old jolyon in whom a desperate honesty welled up at times would allude to his ancestors as yeomen i suppose very small beer <\s>
<s> yet he would repeat the word yeomen as if it afforded him consolation <\s>
<s> eighty six if a day might live another ten years and had never been strong <\s>
<s> swithin and james the twins were only seventy five nicholas a mere baby of seventy or so <\s>
<s> all were strong and the inference was comforting <\s>
<s> of all forms of property their respective healths naturally concerned them most <\s>
<s> i'm very well in myself proceeded james but my nerves are out of order <\s>
<s> the least thing worries me to death <\s>
<s> i shall have to go to bath <\s>
<s> what i want is sea air <\s>
<s> there's nothing like yarmouth <\s>
<s> now when i go there i sleep .... <\s>
<s> my liver's very bad interrupted swithin slowly <\s>
<s> dreadful pain here and he placed his hand on his right side <\s>
<s> want of exercise muttered james his eyes on the china <\s>

<s> swithin reddened a resemblance to a turkey cock coming upon his old face <\s>
<s> i take plenty i never use the lift at the club <\s>
<s> i didn't know james hurried out <\s>
<s> i know nothing about anybody nobody tells me anything .... <\s>
<s> swithin fixed him with a stare what do you do for a pain there <\s>
<s> i take a compound .... <\s>
<s> how are you uncle <\s>
<s> june stood before him her resolute small face raised from her little height to his great height and her hand outheld <\s>
<s> the brightness faded from james's visage <\s>
<s> he said brooding over her <\s>
<s> so you're going to wales to morrow to visit your young man's aunts <\s>
<s> you'll have a lot of rain there <\s>
<s> this isn't real old worcester <\s>
<s> he tapped the bowl <\s>
<s> now that set i gave your mother when she married was the genuine thing <\s>
<s> june shook hands one by one with her three great uncles and turned to aunt ann <\s>
<s> a very sweet look had come into the old lady's face she kissed the girl's check with trembling fervour <\s>
<s> well my dear she said and so you're going for a whole month <\s>
<s> the girl passed on and aunt ann looked after her slim little figure <\s>
<s> the old lady's round steel grey eyes over which a film like a bird's was beginning to come followed her wistfully amongst the bustling crowd for people were beginning to say good bye and her finger tips pressing and pressing against each other were busy again with the recharging of her will against that inevitable ultimate departure of her own <\s>
<s> yes she thought everybody's been most kind quite a lot of people come to congratulate her <\s>
<s> she ought to be very happy <\s>
<s> amongst the throng of people by the door the well dressed throng drawn from the families of lawyers and doctors from the stock exchange and all the innumerable avocations of the upper middle class there were only some twenty percent of forsytes but to aunt ann they seemed all forsytes and certainly there was not much difference she saw only her own flesh and blood <\s>
<s> it was her world this family and she knew no other had never perhaps known any other <\s>
<s> all their little secrets illnesses engagements and marriages how they were getting on and whether they were making money all this was her property her delight her life beyond this only a vague shadowy mist of facts and persons of no real significance <\s>
<s> this it was that she would have to lay down when it came to her turn to die this which gave to her that importance that secret self importance without which none of us can bear to live and to this she clung wistfully with a greed that grew each day <\s>
<s> if life were slipping away from her this she would retain to the end <\s>
<s> she thought of june's father young jolyon who had run away with that foreign girl <\s>
<s> and what a sad blow to his father and to them all <\s>
<s> such a promising young fellow <\s>
<s> a sad blow though there had been no public scandal most fortunately jo's wife seeking for no divorce <\s>
<s> a long time ago <\s>
<s> and when june's mother died six years ago jo had married that woman and they had two children now so she had heard <\s>
<s> still he had forfeited his right to be there had cheated her of the complete fulfilment of her family pride deprived her of the rightful pleasure of seeing and kissing him of whom she had been so proud such a promising young fellow <\s>
<s> the thought rankled with the bitterness of a long inflicted injury in her tenacious old heart <\s>
<s> a little water stood in her eyes <\s>
<s> with a handkerchief of the finest lawn she wiped them stealthily <\s>
<s> said a voice behind <\s>
<s> soames forsyte flat shouldered clean shaven flat cheeked flat waisted yet with something round and secret about his whole appearance looked downwards and aslant at aunt ann as though trying to see through the side of his own nose <\s>
