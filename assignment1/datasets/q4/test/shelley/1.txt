<s> shelley is responsible preface <\s>
<s> the poem entitled alastor may be considered as allegorical of one of the most interesting situations of the human mind <\s>
<s> it represents a youth of uncorrupted feelings and adventurous genius led forth by an imagination inflamed and purified through familiarity with all that is excellent and majestic to the contemplation of the universe <\s>
<s> he drinks deep of the fountains of knowledge and is still insatiate <\s>
<s> the magnificence and beauty of the external world sinks profoundly into the frame of his conceptions and affords to their modifications at variety not to be exhausted <\s>
<s> so long as it is possible for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured he is joyous and tranquil and self possessed <\s>
<s> but the period arrives when these objects cease to suffice <\s>
<s> his mind is at length suddenly awakened and thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself <\s>
<s> he images to himself the being whom he loves <\s>
<s> conversant with speculations of the sublimest and most perfect natures the vision in which he embodies his own imaginations unites all of wonderful or wise or beautiful which the poet the philosopher or the lover could depicture <\s>
<s> the intellectual faculties the imagination the functions of sense have their respective requisitions on the sympathy of corresponding powers in other human beings <\s>
<s> the poet is represented as uniting these requisitions and attaching them to a single image <\s>
<s> he seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception <\s>
<s> blasted by his disappointment he descends to an untimely grave <\s>
<s> the picture is not barren of instruction to actual men <\s>
<s> the poet's self centred seclusion was avenged by the furies of an irresistible passion pursuing him to speedy ruin <\s>

<s> for 2 and 3 mrs <\s>
<s> shelley is responsible preface <\s>
<s> the poem entitled alastor may be considered as allegorical of one of the most interesting situations of the human mind <\s>
<s> it represents a youth of uncorrupted feelings and adventurous genius led forth by an imagination inflamed and purified through familiarity with all that is excellent and majestic to the contemplation of the universe <\s>
<s> he drinks deep of the fountains of knowledge and is still insatiate <\s>
<s> the magnificence and beauty of the external world sinks profoundly into the frame of his conceptions and affords to their modifications at variety not to be exhausted <\s>
<s> so long as it is possible for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured he is joyous and tranquil and self possessed <\s>
<s> but the period arrives when these objects cease to suffice <\s>
<s> his mind is at length suddenly awakened and thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself <\s>
<s> he images to himself the being whom he loves <\s>
<s> conversant with speculations of the sublimest and most perfect natures the vision in which he embodies his own imaginations unites all of wonderful or wise or beautiful which the poet the philosopher or the lover could depicture <\s>
<s> the intellectual faculties the imagination the functions of sense have their respective requisitions on the sympathy of corresponding powers in other human beings <\s>
<s> the poet is represented as uniting these requisitions and attaching them to a single image <\s>
<s> he seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception <\s>
<s> blasted by his disappointment he descends to an untimely grave <\s>
<s> the picture is not barren of instruction to actual men <\s>
<s> the poet's self centred seclusion was avenged by the furies of an irresistible passion pursuing him to speedy ruin <\s>
<s> but that power which strikes the luminaries of the world with sudden darkness and extinction by awakening them to too exquisite a perception of its influences dooms to a slow and poisonous decay those manner spirits that dare to abjure its dominion <\s>
<s> their destiny is more abject and inglorious as their delinquency is more contemptible and pernicious <\s>
<s> they who deluded by no generous error instigated by no sacred thirst of doubtful knowledge duped by no illustrious superstition loving nothing on this earth and cherishing no hopes beyond yet keep aloof from sympathies with their kind rejoicing neither in human joy nor mourning with human grief these and such as they have their apportioned curse <\s>
<s> they languish because none feel with them their common nature <\s>
<s> they are morally dead <\s>
<s> they are neither friends nor lovers nor fathers nor citizens of the world nor benefactors of their country <\s>
<s> among those who attempt to exist without human sympathy the pure and tender hearted perish through the intensity and passion of their search after its communities when the vacancy of their spirit suddenly makes itself felt <\s>
<s> all else selfish blind and torpid are those unforeseeing multitudes who constitute together with their own the lasting misery and loneliness of the world <\s>
<s> those who love not their fellow beings live unfruitful lives and prepare for their old age a miserable grave <\s>
<s> the good die first and those whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to the socket <\s>
<s> alastor or the spirit of solitude <\s>
<s> earth ocean air beloved brotherhood <\s>
<s> if our great mother has imbued my soul with aught of natural piety to feel your love and recompense the boon with mine if dewy morn and odorous noon and even 5 with sunset and its gorgeous ministers and solemn midnight's tingling silentness if autumn's hollow sighs in the sere wood and winter robing with pure snow and crowns of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs 10 if spring's voluptuous pantings when she breathes her first sweet kisses have been dear to me if no bright bird insect or gentle beast i consciously have injured but still loved and cherished these my kindred then forgive 15 this boast beloved brethren and withdraw no portion of your wonted favour now <\s>
<s> mother of this unfathomable world <\s>
<s> favour my solemn song for i have loved thee ever and thee only i have watched 20 thy shadow and the darkness of thy steps and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries <\s>
<s> i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee 25 hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine by forcing some lone ghost thy messenger to render up the tale of what we are <\s>
<s> in lone and silent hours when night makes a weird sound of its own stillness 30 like an inspired and desperate alchymist staking his very life on some dark hope have i mixed awful talk and asking looks with my most innocent love until strange tears uniting with those breathless kisses made 35 such magic as compels the charmed night to render up thy charge ... and though ne'er yet thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary enough from incommunicable dream and twilight phantasms and deep noon day thought 40 has shone within me that serenely now and moveless as a long forgotten lyre suspended in the solitary dome of some mysterious and deserted fane i wait thy breath great parent that my strain 45 may modulate with murmurs of the air and motions of the forests and the sea and voice of living beings and woven hymns of night and day and the deep heart of man <\s>
<s> there was a poet whose untimely tomb 50 no human hands with pious reverence reared but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness a lovely youth no mourning maiden decked 55 with weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath the lone couch of his everlasting sleep gentle and brave and generous no lorn bard breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh he lived he died he sung in solitude <\s>
<s> 60 strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes and virgins as unknown he passed have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes <\s>
<s> the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn and silence too enamoured of that voice 65 locks its mute music in her rugged cell <\s>
<s> by solemn vision and bright silver dream his infancy was nurtured <\s>
<s> every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air sent to his heart its choicest impulses <\s>
<s> 70 the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips and all of great or good or lovely which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates he felt and knew <\s>
<s> when early youth had passed he left 75 his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands <\s>
<s> many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes from savage men 80 his rest and food <\s>
<s> nature's most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued where'er the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke or where bitumen lakes 85 on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge or where the secret caves rugged and dark winding among the springs of fire and poison inaccessible to avarice or pride their starry domes 90 of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls frequent with crystal column and clear shrines of pearl and thrones radiant with chrysolite <\s>
<s> nor had that scene of ampler majesty 95 than gems or gold the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder he would linger long in lonesome vales making the wild his home until the doves and squirrels would partake 100 from his innocuous hand his bloodless food lured by the gentle meaning of his looks and the wild antelope that starts whene'er the dry leaf rustles in the brake suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own <\s>
<s> 105 his wandering step obedient to high thoughts has visited the awful ruins of the days of old athens and tyre and balbec and the waste where stood jerusalem the fallen towers 110 of babylon the eternal pyramids memphis and thebes and whatsoe'er of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk or jasper tomb or mutilated sphynx dark aethiopia in her desert hills 115 conceals <\s>
<s> among the ruined temples there stupendous columns and wild images of more than man where marble daemons watch the zodiac's brazen mystery and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around 120 he lingered poring on memorials of the world's youth through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes nor when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task but ever gazed 125 and gazed till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time <\s>
<s> meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food her daily portion from her father's tent 130 and spread her matting for his couch and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps enamoured yet not daring for deep awe to speak her love and watched his nightly sleep sleepless herself to gaze upon his lips 135 parted in slumber whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose then when red morn made paler the pale moon to her cold home wildered and wan and panting she returned <\s>
<s> the poet wandering on through arabie 140 and persia and the wild carmanian waste and o'er the aerial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves in joy and exultation held his way till in the vale of cashmire far within 145 its loneliest dell where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs <\s>
<s> a vision on his sleep there came a dream of hopes that never yet 150 had flushed his cheek <\s>
<s> he dreamed a veiled maid sate near him talking in low solemn tones <\s>
<s> her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought its music long like woven sounds of streams and breezes held 155 his inmost sense suspended in its web of many coloured woof and shifting hues <\s>
<s> knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme and lofty hopes of divine liberty thoughts the most dear to him and poesy 160 herself a poet <\s>
<s> soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire wild numbers then she raised with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos her fair hands 165 were bare alone sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale <\s>
<s> the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music and her breath 170 tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song <\s>
<s> sudden she rose as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen at the sound he turned and saw by the warm light of their own life 175 her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind her outspread arms now bare her dark locks floating in the breath of night her beamy bending eyes her parted lips outstretched and pale and quivering eagerly <\s>
<s> 180 his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love <\s>
<s> he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath and spread his arms to meet her panting bosom ... she drew back a while then yielding to the irresistible joy 185 with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms <\s>
<s> now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes and night involved and swallowed up the vision sleep like a dark flood suspended in its course 190 rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain <\s>
<s> roused by the shock he started from his trance the cold white light of morning the blue moon low in the west the clear and garish hills the distinct valley and the vacant woods 195 spread round him where he stood <\s>
<s> whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight <\s>
<s> the sounds that soothed his sleep the mystery and the majesty of earth the joy the exultation <\s>
<s> his wan eyes 200 gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven <\s>
