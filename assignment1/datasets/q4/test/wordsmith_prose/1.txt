<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>

<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>

<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>

<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>

<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>

<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>

<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>

<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>

<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>

<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>

<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>
<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>

<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>

<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>

<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>
<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>

<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>

<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>

<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>

<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>

<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>

<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>

<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>

<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>

<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>

<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>

<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>

<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>
<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>

<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>

<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>

<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>
<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>

<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>

<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>

<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>

<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>

<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>

<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>

<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>

<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>

<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>

<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>

<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>

<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>
<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>

<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>

<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>

<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>
<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>

<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>

<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>

<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>

<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>

<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>

<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>

<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>

<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
<s> in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinate a pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are brave by order of monseigneur le duc d'abrantés commander in chief compare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels <\s>
<s> he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure them 'that in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course <\s>
<s> to be the victim of such bloody mindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed them merciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits <\s>
<s> such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its value of virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth <\s>
<s> with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated <\s>
<s> dear spaniards beloved countrymen your habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your security we as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynasty to her to whom an end has been put by that god like providence which rules all thrones and sceptres <\s>
<s> we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate <\s>
<s> an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of france we know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations <\s>
<s> with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishes qualities which are even more to be admired than his great power <\s>
<s> he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare <\s>
<s> whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperity as he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to re organize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies c that the castilians were horror stricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolid he bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren <\s>
<s> his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world <\s>
<s> there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end .... <\s>
<s> shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniards and castilian spaniards yet exist <\s>
<s> many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason <\s>
<s> they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed <\s>
<s> still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself <\s>
<s> we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion <\s>
<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>

<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>

<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>

<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>

<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>

<s> through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes away a perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearly it reminds us of what we love it aims at permanence and the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must last and therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands <\s>
<s> accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible <\s>
<s> in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist <\s>
<s> but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes <\s>
<s> first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness <\s>
<s> the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction <\s>
<s> general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to them the commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch <\s>
<s> we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loaded the unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanction and they refer it to its highest source <\s>
<s> the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i <\s>
<s> and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain <\s>
<s> the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them <\s>
<s> with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors <\s>
<s> the names of pelayo and the cid are the watch words of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed <\s>
<s> the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens <\s>
<s> imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors <\s>
<s> the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner <\s>
<s> and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his country life or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferent ye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverers ye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy <\s>
<s> and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest <\s>
<s> they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible <\s>
<s> the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it <\s>
<s> therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace <\s>
<s> but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justice hopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence <\s>
<s> all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation <\s>
<s> france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous <\s>
<s> she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause <\s>
<s> she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved <\s>
<s> to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies <\s>
<s> the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid <\s>
<s> seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favour which ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices <\s>
<s> blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nation she has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of our's has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you <\s>
<s> the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist <\s>
<s> the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance <\s>
<s> and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance <\s>
<s> that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror <\s>
<s> we all spain exclaim the spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge <\s>
<s> comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country <\s>
<s> assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause <\s>
<s> again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us <\s>
<s> come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us <\s>
<s> you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeance obey not the authors of your misfortunes attack them they are but a handful of miserable panic struck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world <\s>
<s> rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy them our united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like men such are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted <\s>
<s> care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness <\s>
<s> things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c <\s>
<s> one extract more and i shall conclude <\s>
<s> it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th <\s>
<s> yes spain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery <\s>
<s> if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph <\s>
<s> a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies <\s>
<s> those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny <\s>
<s> spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself <\s>
<s> i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him <\s>
<s> he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god <\s>
<s> he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hope despair comes not near them they will die they say each individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victorious or at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are their's and cannot be relinquished <\s>
<s> and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evil doer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of re constructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers <\s>
<s> woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause <\s>
<s> it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other <\s>
<s> it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them <\s>
<s> the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen it it is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to re infuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist <\s>
<s> if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred <\s>
<s> is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind <\s>
<s> have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause <\s>
<s> and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment <\s>
<s> an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them <\s>
<s> and this i shall prove by trying this act of their's by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given <\s>
<s> i shall now proceed to facts <\s>
<s> the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation <\s>
<s> the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthur's second letter <\s>
<s> in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc d'abrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c <\s>
<s> in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british head quarters to treat for terms <\s>
<s> this was joyful intelligence <\s>
<s> first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemy's military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of long continued success <\s>
<s> the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice <\s>
<s> they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy <\s>
<s> but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes <\s>
<s> it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze <\s>
<s> they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risen remembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england <\s>
<s> why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest <\s>
<s> they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them <\s>
<s> had they deserved to be thus neglected <\s>
<s> the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them <\s>
<s> it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies <\s>
<s> situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain <\s>
