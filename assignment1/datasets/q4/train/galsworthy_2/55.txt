<s> tell us about uncle soames granny <\s>
<s> why is he so keen on mother's getting a divorce <\s>
<s> your uncle soames said emily and her voice had in it an exaggerated assurance is a lawyer my dear boy <\s>
<s> he's sure to know best <\s>
<s> but what did become of aunt irene <\s>
<s> i remember she was jolly good looking <\s>
<s> it's my first term you know <\s>
<s> i don't want to be up there when it comes off <\s>
<s> my dear boy murmured winifred it is a bore for you <\s>
<s> so by habit she phrased what from the expression of her face was the most poignant regret <\s>
<s> when will it be soames <\s>
<s> can't tell not for months <\s>
<s> we must get restitution first <\s>
<s> what the deuce is that <\s>
<s> what silly brutes lawyers are <\s>
<s> i know one thing i'm not going to dine in <\s>
<s> and he said awfully sorry mother i've got to go out to dinner now <\s>
<s> though it was his last night winifred nodded almost gratefully they both felt that they had gone quite far enough in the expression of feeling <\s>
<s> val sought the misty freedom of green street reckless and depressed <\s>
<s> and not till he reached piccadilly did he discover that he had only eighteen pence <\s>
<s> one couldn't dine off eighteen pence and he was very hungry <\s>
<s> he looked longingly at the windows of the iseeum club where he had often eaten of the best with his father <\s>
<s> there was no getting over them <\s>
<s> but the more he brooded and the further he walked the hungrier he naturally became <\s>
<s> short of trailing home there were only two places where he could go his grandfather's in park lane and timothy's in the bayswater road <\s>
<s> which was the less deplorable <\s>
<s> at his grandfather's he would probably get a better dinner on the spur of the moment <\s>
<s> at timothy's they gave you a jolly good feed when they expected you not otherwise <\s>
<s> he decided on park lane not unmoved by the thought that to go up to oxford without affording his grandfather a chance to tip him was hardly fair to either of them <\s>
<s> his mother would hear he had been there of course and might think it funny but he couldn't help that <\s>
<s> he rang the bell <\s>
<s> hullo warmson any dinner for me d'you think <\s>
<s> they're just going in master val <\s>
<s> forsyte will be very glad to see you <\s>
<s> he was saying at lunch that he never saw you nowadays <\s>
<s> well here i am <\s>
<s> kill the fatted calf warmson let's have fizz <\s>
<s> warmson smiled faintly in his opinion val was a young limb <\s>
<s> i will ask mrs <\s>
<s> i say val grumbled taking off his overcoat i'm not at school any more you know <\s>
