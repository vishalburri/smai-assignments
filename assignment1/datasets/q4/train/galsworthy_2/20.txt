<s> without saying a word therefore to anyone he took a hansom to the station and proceeded by train to robin hill thence there being no flies in accordance with the custom of the neighbourhood he found himself obliged to walk <\s>
<s> he started slowly up the hill his angular knees and high shoulders bent complainingly his eyes fixed on his feet yet neat for all that in his high hat and his frock coat on which was the speckless gloss imparted by perfect superintendence <\s>
<s> emily saw to that that is she did not of course see to it people of good position not seeing to each other's buttons and emily was of good position but she saw that the butler saw to it <\s>
<s> he had to ask his way three times on each occasion he repeated the directions given him got the man to repeat them then repeated them a second time for he was naturally of a talkative disposition and one could not be too careful in a new neighbourhood <\s>
<s> he kept assuring them that it was a new house he was looking for it was only however when he was shown the roof through the trees that he could feel really satisfied that he had not been directed entirely wrong <\s>
<s> a heavy sky seemed to cover the world with the grey whiteness of a whitewashed ceiling <\s>
<s> there was no freshness or fragrance in the air <\s>
<s> on such a day even british workmen scarcely cared to do more then they were obliged and moved about their business without the drone of talk which whiles away the pangs of labour <\s>
<s> through spaces of the unfinished house shirt sleeved figures worked slowly and sounds arose spasmodic knockings the scraping of metal the sawing of wood with the rumble of wheelbarrows along boards now and again the foreman's dog tethered by a string to an oaken beam whimpered feebly with a sound like the singing of a kettle <\s>
<s> the fresh fitted window panes daubed each with a white patch in the centre stared out at james like the eyes of a blind dog <\s>
<s> and the building chorus went on strident and mirthless under the grey white sky <\s>
<s> but the thrushes hunting amongst the fresh turned earth for worms were silent quite <\s>
<s> james picked his way among the heaps of gravel the drive was being laid till he came opposite the porch <\s>
<s> here he stopped and raised his eyes <\s>
<s> there was but little to see from this point of view and that little he took in at once but he stayed in this position many minutes and who shall know of what he thought <\s>
<s> his china blue eyes under white eyebrows that jutted out in little horns never stirred the long upper lip of his wide mouth between the fine white whiskers twitched once or twice it was easy to see from that anxious rapt expression whence soames derived the handicapped look which sometimes came upon his face <\s>
<s> james might have been saying to himself i don't know life's a tough job <\s>
<s> in this position bosinney surprised him <\s>
<s> james brought his eyes down from whatever bird's nest they had been looking for in the sky to bosinney's face on which was a kind of humorous scorn <\s>
<s> how do you do mr <\s>
<s> come down to see for yourself <\s>
<s> it was exactly what james as we know had come for and he was made correspondingly uneasy <\s>
<s> he held out his hand however saying how are you <\s>
<s> without looking at bosinney <\s>
<s> the latter made way for him with an ironical smile <\s>
<s> james scented something suspicious in this courtesy <\s>
<s> i should like to walk round the outside first he said and see what you've been doing <\s>
<s> a flagged terrace of rounded stones with a list of two or three inches to port had been laid round the south east and south west sides of the house and ran with a bevelled edge into mould which was in preparation for being turfed along this terrace james led the way <\s>
<s> now what did this cost <\s>
<s> he asked when he saw the terrace extending round the corner <\s>
<s> what should you think <\s>
<s> how should i know <\s>
<s> replied james somewhat nonplussed two or three hundred i dare say <\s>
<s> james gave him a sharp look but the architect appeared unconscious and he put the answer down to mishearing <\s>
<s> on arriving at the garden entrance he stopped to look at the view <\s>
<s> that ought to come down he said pointing to the oak tree <\s>
<s> you think that with the tree there you don't get enough view for your money <\s>
<s> again james eyed him suspiciously this young man had a peculiar way of putting things well <\s>
<s> he said with a perplexed nervous emphasis i don't see what you want with a tree <\s>
<s> it shall come down to morrow said bosinney <\s>
<s> oh he said don't go saying i said it was to come down <\s>
<s> i know nothing about it <\s>
<s> james went on in a fluster why what should i know about it <\s>
<s> it's nothing to do with me <\s>
<s> you do it on your own responsibility <\s>
<s> you'll allow me to mention your name <\s>
<s> james grew more and more alarmed i don't know what you want mentioning my name for he muttered you'd better leave the tree alone <\s>
<s> it's not your tree <\s>
<s> he took out a silk handkerchief and wiped his brow <\s>
<s> they entered the house <\s>
<s> like swithin james was impressed by the inner court yard <\s>
<s> you must have spent a deuce of a lot of money here he said after staring at the columns and gallery for some time <\s>
<s> now what did it cost to put up those columns <\s>
<s> i can't tell you off hand thoughtfully answered bosinney but i know it was a deuce of a lot <\s>
<s> i should think so said james <\s>
<s> he caught the architect's eye and broke off <\s>
<s> and now whenever he came to anything of which he desired to know the cost he stifled that curiosity <\s>
