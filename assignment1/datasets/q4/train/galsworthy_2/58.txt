<s> why didn't you divorce me then <\s>

<s> he stopped and looked at her intently with a sort of curiosity <\s>
<s> what on earth did she do with herself if she really lived quite alone <\s>
<s> and why had he not divorced her <\s>
<s> the old feeling that she had never understood him never done him justice bit him while he stared at her <\s>
<s> why couldn't you have made me a good wife <\s>
<s> yes it was a crime to marry you <\s>
<s> i have paid for it <\s>
<s> you will find some way perhaps <\s>
<s> you needn't mind my name i have none to lose <\s>
<s> now i think you had better go <\s>
<s> a sense of defeat of being defrauded of his self justification and of something else beyond power of explanation to himself beset soames like the breath of a cold fog <\s>
<s> mechanically he reached up took from the mantel shelf a little china bowl reversed it and said lowestoft <\s>
<s> where did you get this <\s>
<s> i bought its fellow at jobson's <\s>
<s> and visited by the sudden memory of how those many years ago he and she had bought china together he remained staring at the little bowl as if it contained all the past <\s>
<s> her voice roused him <\s>
<s> i don't want it <\s>
<s> soames put it back on the shelf <\s>
<s> will you shake hands <\s>
<s> a faint smile curved her lips <\s>
<s> she held out her hand <\s>
<s> it was cold to his rather feverish touch <\s>
<s> she's made of ice he thought 'she was always made of ice <\s>
<s> but even as that thought darted through him his senses were assailed by the perfume of her dress and body as though the warmth within her which had never been for him were struggling to show its presence <\s>
<s> and he turned on his heel <\s>
<s> he walked out and away as if someone with a whip were after him not even looking for a cab glad of the empty embankment and the cold river and the thick strewn shadows of the plane tree leaves confused flurried sore at heart and vaguely disturbed as though he had made some deep mistake whose consequences he could not foresee <\s>
<s> and the fantastic thought suddenly assailed him if instead of i think you had better go she had said i think you had better stay <\s>
<s> what should he have felt what would he have done <\s>
<s> that cursed attraction of her was there for him even now after all these years of estrangement and bitter thoughts <\s>
<s> it was there ready to mount to his head at a sign a touch <\s>
<s> i was a fool to go <\s>
<s> memory flown back to the first years of his marriage played him torturing tricks <\s>
<s> she had not deserved to keep her beauty the beauty he had owned and known so well <\s>
<s> and a kind of bitterness at the tenacity of his own admiration welled up in him <\s>
<s> most men would have hated the sight of her as she had deserved <\s>
<s> she had spoiled his life wounded his pride to death defrauded him of a son <\s>
<s> and yet the mere sight of her cold and resisting as ever had this power to upset him utterly <\s>
<s> it was some damned magnetism she had <\s>
<s> and no wonder if as she asserted she had lived untouched these last twelve years <\s>
<s> so bosinney cursed be his memory had lived on all this time with her <\s>
<s> soames could not tell whether he was glad of that knowledge or no <\s>
<s> nearing his club at last he stopped to buy a paper <\s>
<s> a headline ran boers reported to repudiate suzerainty <\s>
<s> he thought she always did <\s>
<s> i still have it by rights <\s>
<s> she must be awfully lonely in that wretched little flat <\s>
<s> chapter xii on forsyte change soames belonged to two clubs the connoisseurs which he put on his cards and seldom visited and the remove which he did not put on his cards and frequented <\s>
<s> he had joined this liberal institution five years ago having made sure that its members were now nearly all sound conservatives in heart and pocket if not in principle <\s>
