<s> said jolyon holding out his hand <\s>
<s> and yet to tell of what he had chanced on was against his creed <\s>
<s> in this dilemma he went and sat in the old leather chair and crossed his legs <\s>
<s> it grew dark while he sat there staring out through the long window at the old oak tree ample yet bare of leaves becoming slowly just a shape of deeper dark printed on the dusk <\s>
<s> he thought without sequence and took out his watch <\s>
<s> he could not see the hands but he set the repeater going <\s>
<s> his grandfather's first gold hunter watch butter smooth with age all the milling worn from it and dented with the mark of many a fall <\s>
<s> the chime was like a little voice from out of that golden age when they first came from st <\s>
<s> john's wood london to this house came driving with grandfather in his carriage and almost instantly took to the trees <\s>
<s> trees to climb and grandfather watering the geranium beds below <\s>
<s> what was to be done <\s>
<s> tell dad he must come home <\s>
<s> confide in june only she was so so sudden <\s>
<s> do nothing and trust to luck <\s>
<s> after all the vac <\s>
<s> would soon be over <\s>
<s> go up and see val and warn him off <\s>
<s> but how get his address <\s>
<s> holly wouldn't give it him <\s>
<s> a maze of paths a cloud of possibilities <\s>
<s> he lit a cigarette <\s>
<s> when he had smoked it halfway through his brow relaxed almost as if some thin old hand had been passed gently over it and in his ear something seemed to whisper do nothing be nice to holly be nice to her my dear <\s>
<s> and jolly heaved a sigh of contentment blowing smoke through his nostrils .... <\s>
<s> but up in her room divested of her habit holly was still frowning <\s>
<s> he is not he is not <\s>
<s> were the words which kept forming on her lips <\s>
<s> chapter vi jolyon in two minds a little private hotel over a well known restaurant near the gare st <\s>
<s> lazare was jolyon's haunt in paris <\s>
<s> he hated his fellow forsytes abroad vapid as fish out of water in their well trodden runs the opera rue de rivoli and moulin rouge <\s>
<s> their air of having come because they wanted to be somewhere else as soon as possible annoyed him <\s>
<s> but no other forsyte came near this haunt where he had a wood fire in his bedroom and the coffee was excellent <\s>
<s> paris was always to him more attractive in winter <\s>
<s> the acrid savour from woodsmoke and chestnut roasting braziers the sharpness of the wintry sunshine on bright rays the open cafes defying keen aired winter the self contained brisk boulevard crowds all informed him that in winter paris possessed a soul which like a migrant bird in high summer flew away <\s>
<s> he spoke french well had some friends knew little places where pleasant dishes could be met with queer types observed <\s>
<s> he felt philosophic in paris the edge of irony sharpened life took on a subtle purposeless meaning became a bunch of flavours tasted a darkness shot with shifting gleams of light <\s>
<s> when in the first week of december he decided to go to paris he was far from admitting that irene's presence was influencing him <\s>
<s> he had not been there two days before he owned that the wish to see her had been more than half the reason <\s>
<s> in england one did not admit what was natural <\s>
<s> he had thought it might be well to speak to her about the letting of her flat and other matters but in paris he at once knew better <\s>
<s> there was a glamour over the city <\s>
<s> on the third day he wrote to her and received an answer which procured him a pleasurable shiver of the nerves my dear jolyon it will be a happiness for me to see you <\s>
<s> he took his way to her hotel on a bright day with a feeling such as he had often had going to visit an adored picture <\s>
<s> no woman so far as he remembered had ever inspired in him this special sensuous and yet impersonal sensation <\s>
<s> he was going to sit and feast his eyes and come away knowing her no better but ready to go and feast his eyes again to morrow <\s>
<s> such was his feeling when in the tarnished and ornate little lounge of a quiet hotel near the river she came to him preceded by a small page boy who uttered the word madame and vanished <\s>
<s> her face her smile the poise of her figure were just as he had pictured and the expression of her face said plainly a friend <\s>
<s> well he said what news poor exile <\s>
<s> i have let the flat for you and like a good steward i bring you some money <\s>
<s> how do you like paris <\s>
<s> while he put her through this catechism it seemed to him that he had never seen lips so fine and sensitive the lower lip curving just a little upwards the upper touched at one corner by the least conceivable dimple <\s>
<s> it was like discovering a woman in what had hitherto been a sort of soft and breathed on statue almost impersonally admired <\s>
<s> she owned that to be alone in paris was a little difficult and yet paris was so full of its own life that it was often she confessed as innocuous as a desert <\s>
<s> besides the english were not liked just now <\s>
<s> that will hardly be your case said jolyon you should appeal to the french <\s>
<s> it has its disadvantages <\s>
<s> well you must let me take you about while i'm here <\s>
<s> come and dine at my pet restaurant and we'll go to the opera comique <\s>
<s> it was the beginning of daily meetings <\s>
<s> jolyon soon found that for those who desired a static condition of the affections paris was at once the first and last place in which to be friendly with a pretty woman <\s>
<s> revelation was alighting like a bird in his heart singing elle est ton reve <\s>
<s> elle est ton reve <\s>
<s> sometimes this seemed natural sometimes ludicrous a bad case of elderly rapture <\s>
<s> having once been ostracised by society he had never since had any real regard for conventional morality but the idea of a love which she could never return and how could she at his age hardly mounted beyond his subconscious mind <\s>
<s> he was full too of resentment at the waste and loneliness of her life <\s>
<s> aware of being some comfort to her and of the pleasure she clearly took in their many little outings he was amiably desirous of doing and saying nothing to destroy that pleasure <\s>
<s> it was like watching a starved plant draw up water to see her drink in his companionship <\s>
<s> so far as they could tell no one knew her address except himself she was unknown in paris and he but little known so that discretion seemed unnecessary in those walks talks visits to concerts picture galleries theatres little dinners expeditions to versailles st <\s>
<s> and time fled one of those full months without past to it or future <\s>
<s> what in his youth would certainly have been headlong passion was now perhaps as deep a feeling but far gentler tempered to protective companionship by admiration hopelessness and a sense of chivalry arrested in his veins at least so long as she was there smiling and happy in their friendship and always to him more beautiful and spiritually responsive for her philosophy of life seemed to march in admirable step with his own conditioned by emotion more than by reason ironically mistrustful susceptible to beauty almost passionately humane and tolerant yet subject to instinctive rigidities of which as a mere man he was less capable <\s>
<s> and during all this companionable month he never quite lost that feeling with which he had set out on the first day as if to visit an adored work of art a well nigh impersonal desire <\s>
<s> the future inexorable pendant to the present he took care not to face for fear of breaking up his untroubled manner but he made plans to renew this time in places still more delightful where the sun was hot and there were strange things to see and paint <\s>
<s> the end came swiftly on the 20th of january with a telegram have enlisted in imperial yeomanry <\s>
<s> jolyon received it just as he was setting out to meet her at the louvre <\s>
<s> it brought him up with a round turn <\s>
<s> while he was lotus eating here his boy whose philosopher and guide he ought to be had taken this great step towards danger hardship perhaps even death <\s>
<s> he felt disturbed to the soul realising suddenly how irene had twined herself round the roots of his being <\s>
<s> thus threatened with severance the tie between them for it had become a kind of tie no longer had impersonal quality <\s>
<s> the tranquil enjoyment of things in common jolyon perceived was gone for ever <\s>
<s> he saw his feeling as it was in the nature of an infatuation <\s>
<s> ridiculous perhaps but so real that sooner or later it must disclose itself <\s>
<s> and now as it seemed to him he could not must not make any such disclosure <\s>
<s> the news of jolly stood inexorably in the way <\s>
<s> he was proud of this enlistment proud of his boy for going off to fight for the country for on jolyon's pro boerism too black week had left its mark <\s>
