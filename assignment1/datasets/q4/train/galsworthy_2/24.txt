<s> and all the cruelties and hardness of life its pathos and unequal chances its conceit self forgetfulness and patience were presented on the battle field of this kensington ball room <\s>
<s> here and there too lovers not lovers like francie's a peculiar breed but simply lovers trembling blushing silent sought each other by flying glances sought to meet and touch in the mazes of the dance and now and again dancing together struck some beholder by the light in their eyes <\s>
<s> not a second before ten o'clock came the jameses emily rachel winifred dartie had been left behind having on a former occasion drunk too much of roger's champagne and cicely the youngest making her debut behind them following in a hansom from the paternal mansion where they had dined soames and irene <\s>
<s> all these ladies had shoulder straps and no tulle thus showing at once by a bolder exposure of flesh that they came from the more fashionable side of the park <\s>
<s> soames sidling back from the contact of the dancers took up a position against the wall <\s>
<s> guarding himself with his pale smile he stood watching <\s>
<s> waltz after waltz began and ended couple after couple brushed by with smiling lips laughter and snatches of talk or with set lips and eyes searching the throng or again with silent parted lips and eyes on each other <\s>
<s> and the scent of festivity the odour of flowers and hair of essences that women love rose suffocatingly in the heat of the summer night <\s>
<s> silent with something of scorn in his smile soames seemed to notice nothing but now and again his eyes finding that which they sought would fix themselves on a point in the shifting throng and the smile die off his lips <\s>
<s> he danced with no one <\s>
<s> some fellows danced with their wives his sense of form had never permitted him to dance with irene since their marriage and the god of the forsytes alone can tell whether this was a relief to him or not <\s>
<s> she passed dancing with other men her dress iris coloured floating away from her feet <\s>
<s> she danced well he was tired of hearing women say with an acid smile how beautifully your wife dances mr <\s>
<s> forsyte it's quite a pleasure to watch her <\s>
<s> tired of answering them with his sidelong glance you think so <\s>
<s> a young couple close by flirted a fan by turns making an unpleasant draught <\s>
<s> francie and one of her lovers stood near <\s>
<s> they were talking of love <\s>
<s> he heard roger's voice behind giving an order about supper to a servant <\s>
<s> everything was very second class <\s>
<s> he wished that he had not come <\s>
<s> he had asked irene whether she wanted him she had answered with that maddening smile of hers oh no <\s>
<s> why had he come <\s>
<s> for the last quarter of an hour he had not even seen her <\s>
<s> here was george advancing with his quilpish face it was too late to get out of his way <\s>
<s> have you seen the buccaneer <\s>
<s> said this licensed wag he's on the warpath hair cut and everything <\s>
<s> soames said he had not and crossing the room half empty in an interval of the dance he went out on the balcony and looked down into the street <\s>
<s> a carriage had driven up with late arrivals and round the door hung some of those patient watchers of the london streets who spring up to the call of light or music their faces pale and upturned above their black and rusty figures had an air of stolid watching that annoyed soames <\s>
<s> why were they allowed to hang about why didn't the bobby move them on <\s>
<s> but the policeman took no notice of them his feet were planted apart on the strip of crimson carpet stretched across the pavement his face under the helmet wore the same stolid watching look as theirs <\s>
<s> across the road through the railings soames could see the branches of trees shining faintly stirring in the breeze by the gleam of the street lamps beyond again the upper lights of the houses on the other side so many eyes looking down on the quiet blackness of the garden and over all the sky that wonderful london sky dusted with the innumerable reflection of countless lamps a dome woven over between its stars with the refraction of human needs and human fancies immense mirror of pomp and misery that night after night stretches its kindly mocking over miles of houses and gardens mansions and squalor over forsytes policemen and patient watchers in the streets <\s>
<s> soames turned away and hidden in the recess gazed into the lighted room <\s>
<s> it was cooler out there <\s>
<s> he saw the new arrivals june and her grandfather enter <\s>
<s> what had made them so late <\s>
<s> they stood by the doorway <\s>
<s> fancy uncle jolyon turning out at this time of night <\s>
<s> why hadn't june come to irene as she usually did and it occurred to him suddenly that he had seen nothing of june for a long time now <\s>
<s> watching her face with idle malice he saw it change grow so pale that he thought she would drop then flame out crimson <\s>
<s> turning to see at what she was looking he saw his wife on bosinney's arm coming from the conservatory at the end of the room <\s>
<s> her eyes were raised to his as though answering some question he had asked and he was gazing at her intently <\s>
<s> soames looked again at june <\s>
<s> her hand rested on old jolyon's arm she seemed to be making a request <\s>
<s> he saw a surprised look on his uncle's face they turned and passed through the door out of his sight <\s>
<s> the music began again a waltz and still as a statue in the recess of the window his face unmoved but no smile on his lips soames waited <\s>
<s> presently within a yard of the dark balcony his wife and bosinney passed <\s>
<s> he caught the perfume of the gardenias that she wore saw the rise and fall of her bosom the languor in her eyes her parted lips and a look on her face that he did not know <\s>
<s> to the slow swinging measure they danced by and it seemed to him that they clung to each other he saw her raise her eyes soft and dark to bosinney's and drop them again <\s>
<s> very white he turned back to the balcony and leaning on it gazed down on the square the figures were still there looking up at the light with dull persistency the policeman's face too upturned and staring but he saw nothing of them <\s>
<s> below a carriage drew up two figures got in and drove away .... <\s>
<s> that evening june and old jolyon sat down to dinner at the usual hour <\s>
<s> the girl was in her customary high necked frock old jolyon had not dressed <\s>
<s> at breakfast she had spoken of the dance at uncle roger's she wanted to go she had been stupid enough she said not to think of asking anyone to take her <\s>
<s> it was too late now <\s>
