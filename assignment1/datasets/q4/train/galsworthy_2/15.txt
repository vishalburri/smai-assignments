<s> from that high and sacred field where thousands of the upper middle class lay in their last sleep the eyes of the forsytes travelled down across the flocks of graves <\s>
<s> there spreading to the distance lay london with no sun over it mourning the loss of its daughter mourning with this family so dear the loss of her who was mother and guardian <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand spires and houses blurred in the great grey web of property lay there like prostrate worshippers before the grave of this the oldest forsyte of them all <\s>
<s> a few words a sprinkle of earth the thrusting of the coffin home and aunt ann had passed to her last rest <\s>
<s> round the vault trustees of that passing the five brothers stood with white heads bowed they would see that ann was comfortable where she was going <\s>
<s> her little property must stay behind but otherwise all that could be should be done .... <\s>
<s> then severally each stood aside and putting on his hat turned back to inspect the new inscription on the marble of the family vault sacred to the memory of ann forsyte the daughter of the above jolyon and ann forsyte who departed this life the 27th day of september 1886 aged eighty seven years and four days soon perhaps someone else would be wanting an inscription <\s>
<s> it was strange and intolerable for they had not thought somehow that forsytes could die <\s>
<s> and one and all they had a longing to get away from this painfulness this ceremony which had reminded them of things they could not bear to think about to get away quickly and go about their business and forget <\s>
<s> it was cold too the wind like some slow disintegrating force blowing up the hill over the graves struck them with its chilly breath they began to split into groups and as quickly as possible to fill the waiting carriages <\s>
<s> swithin said he should go back to lunch at timothy's and he offered to take anybody with him in his brougham <\s>
<s> it was considered a doubtful privilege to drive with swithin in his brougham which was not a large one nobody accepted and he went off alone <\s>
<s> james and roger followed immediately after they also would drop in to lunch <\s>
<s> the others gradually melted away old jolyon taking three nephews to fill up his carriage he had a want of those young faces <\s>
<s> soames who had to arrange some details in the cemetery office walked away with bosinney <\s>
<s> he had much to talk over with him and having finished his business they strolled to hampstead lunched together at the spaniard's inn and spent a long time in going into practical details connected with the building of the house they then proceeded to the tram line and came as far as the marble arch where bosinney went off to stanhope gate to see june <\s>
<s> soames felt in excellent spirits when he arrived home and confided to irene at dinner that he had had a good talk with bosinney who really seemed a sensible fellow they had had a capital walk too which had done his liver good he had been short of exercise for a long time and altogether a very satisfactory day <\s>
<s> if only it hadn't been for poor aunt ann he would have taken her to the theatre as it was they must make the best of an evening at home <\s>
<s> the buccaneer asked after you more than once he said suddenly <\s>
<s> and moved by some inexplicable desire to assert his proprietorship he rose from his chair and planted a kiss on his wife's shoulder <\s>
<s> part ii chapter i progress of the house the winter had been an open one <\s>
<s> things in the trade were slack and as soames had reflected before making up his mind it had been a good time for building <\s>
<s> the shell of the house at robin hill was thus completed by the end of april <\s>
<s> now that there was something to be seen for his money he had been coming down once twice even three times a week and would mouse about among the debris for hours careful never to soil his clothes moving silently through the unfinished brickwork of doorways or circling round the columns in the central court <\s>
<s> and he would stand before them for minutes together as though peering into the real quality of their substance <\s>
<s> on april 30 he had an appointment with bosinney to go over the accounts and five minutes before the proper time he entered the tent which the architect had pitched for himself close to the old oak tree <\s>
<s> the accounts were already prepared on a folding table and with a nod soames sat down to study them <\s>
<s> it was some time before he raised his head <\s>
<s> i can't make them out he said at last they come to nearly seven hundred more than they ought <\s>
<s> after a glance at bosinney's face he went on quickly if you only make a firm stand against these builder chaps you'll get them down <\s>
<s> they stick you with everything if you don't look sharp .... <\s>
<s> take ten per cent <\s>
<s> i shan't mind it's coming out a hundred or so over the mark <\s>
<s> bosinney shook his head i've taken off every farthing i can <\s>
<s> soames pushed back the table with a movement of anger which sent the account sheets fluttering to the ground <\s>
<s> then all i can say is he flustered out you've made a pretty mess of it <\s>
<s> i've told you a dozen times bosinney answered sharply that there'd be extras <\s>
<s> i've pointed them out to you over and over again <\s>
<s> i know that growled soames i shouldn't have objected to a ten pound note here and there <\s>
<s> how was i to know that by extras you meant seven hundred pounds <\s>
<s> the qualities of both men had contributed to this not inconsiderable discrepancy <\s>
<s> on the one hand the architect's devotion to his idea to the image of a house which he had created and believed in had made him nervous of being stopped or forced to the use of makeshifts on the other soames not less true and wholehearted devotion to the very best article that could be obtained for the money had rendered him averse to believing that things worth thirteen shillings could not be bought with twelve <\s>
<s> i wish i'd never undertaken your house said bosinney suddenly <\s>
<s> you come down here worrying me out of my life <\s>
<s> you want double the value for your money anybody else would and now that you've got a house that for its size is not to be beaten in the county you don't want to pay for it <\s>
<s> if you're anxious to be off your bargain i daresay i can find the balance above the estimates myself but i'm d  d if i do another stroke of work for you <\s>
<s> soames regained his composure <\s>
<s> knowing that bosinney had no capital he regarded this as a wild suggestion <\s>
<s> he saw too that he would be kept indefinitely out of this house on which he had set his heart and just at the crucial point when the architect's personal care made all the difference <\s>
<s> in the meantime there was irene to be thought of <\s>
<s> she had been very queer lately <\s>
<s> he really believed it was only because she had taken to bosinney that she tolerated the idea of the house at all <\s>
<s> it would not do to make an open breach with her <\s>
<s> you needn't get into a rage he said <\s>
<s> if i'm willing to put up with it i suppose you needn't cry out <\s>
<s> all i meant was that when you tell me a thing is going to cost so much i like to well in fact i like to know where i am <\s>
<s> said bosinney and soames was both annoyed and surprised by the shrewdness of his glance <\s>
<s> you've got my services dirt cheap <\s>
<s> for the kind of work i've put into this house and the amount of time i've given to it you'd have had to pay littlemaster or some other fool four times as much <\s>
<s> what you want in fact is a first rate man for a fourth rate fee and that's exactly what you've got <\s>
<s> soames saw that he really meant what he said and angry though he was the consequences of a row rose before him too vividly <\s>
<s> he saw his house unfinished his wife rebellious himself a laughingstock <\s>
<s> let's go over it he said sulkily and see how the money's gone <\s>
<s> very well assented bosinney <\s>
<s> but we'll hurry up if you don't mind <\s>
<s> i have to get back in time to take june to the theatre <\s>
<s> soames cast a stealthy look at him and said coming to our place i suppose to meet her <\s>
<s> he was always coming to their place <\s>
<s> there had been rain the night before a spring rain and the earth smelt of sap and wild grasses <\s>
<s> the warm soft breeze swung the leaves and the golden buds of the old oak tree and in the sunshine the blackbirds were whistling their hearts out <\s>
<s> it was such a spring day as breathes into a man an ineffable yearning a painful sweetness a longing that makes him stand motionless looking at the leaves or grass and fling out his arms to embrace he knows not what <\s>
<s> the earth gave forth a fainting warmth stealing up through the chilly garment in which winter had wrapped her <\s>
<s> it was her long caress of invitation to draw men down to lie within her arms to roll their bodies on her and put their lips to her breast <\s>
<s> on just such a day as this soames had got from irene the promise he had asked her for so often <\s>
<s> seated on the fallen trunk of a tree he had promised for the twentieth time that if their marriage were not a success she should be as free as if she had never married him <\s>
<s> do you swear it <\s>
<s> a few days back she had reminded him of that oath <\s>
<s> he had answered nonsense <\s>
<s> i couldn't have sworn any such thing <\s>
<s> by some awkward fatality he remembered it now <\s>
<s> what queer things men would swear for the sake of women <\s>
<s> he would have sworn it at any time to gain her <\s>
<s> he would swear it now if thereby he could touch her but nobody could touch her she was cold hearted <\s>
<s> and memories crowded on him with the fresh sweet savour of the spring wind memories of his courtship <\s>
<s> in the spring of the year 1881 he was visiting his old school fellow and client george liversedge of branksome who with the view of developing his pine woods in the neighbourhood of bournemouth had placed the formation of the company necessary to the scheme in soames's hands <\s>
<s> liversedge with a sense of the fitness of things had given a musical tea in his honour <\s>
<s> later in the course of this function which soames no musician had regarded as an unmitigated bore his eye had been caught by the face of a girl dressed in mourning standing by herself <\s>
<s> the lines of her tall as yet rather thin figure showed through the wispy clinging stuff of her black dress her black gloved hands were crossed in front of her her lips slightly parted and her large dark eyes wandered from face to face <\s>
<s> her hair done low on her neck seemed to gleam above her black collar like coils of shining metal <\s>
<s> and as soames stood looking at her the sensation that most men have felt at one time or another went stealing through him a peculiar satisfaction of the senses a peculiar certainty which novelists and old ladies call love at first sight <\s>
<s> still stealthily watching her he at once made his way to his hostess and stood doggedly waiting for the music to cease <\s>
<s> who is that girl with yellow hair and dark eyes <\s>
<s> her father professor heron died this year <\s>
<s> she lives with her stepmother <\s>
<s> she's a nice girl a pretty girl but no money <\s>
<s> introduce me please said soames <\s>
<s> it was very little that he found to say nor did he find her responsive to that little <\s>
