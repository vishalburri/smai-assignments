<s> how did she know <\s>
<s> she could not tell him but she knew <\s>
<s> she knew nearly for certain <\s>
<s> it was most unlikely circumstances had changed <\s>
<s> irene's words still rang in her head i have left soames <\s>
<s> where should i go <\s>
<s> but she kept silence about that <\s>
<s> if her grandfather would only buy it and settle that wretched claim that ought never to have been made on phil <\s>
<s> it would be the very best thing for everybody and everything everything might come straight <\s>
<s> and june put her lips to his forehead and pressed them close <\s>
<s> but old jolyon freed himself from her caress his face wore the judicial look which came upon it when he dealt with affairs <\s>
<s> he asked what did she mean <\s>
<s> there was something behind all this had she been seeing bosinney <\s>
<s> june answered no but i have been to his rooms <\s>
<s> been to his rooms <\s>
<s> who took you there <\s>
<s> june faced him steadily <\s>
<s> he has lost that case <\s>
<s> i don't care whether it was right or wrong <\s>
<s> i want to help him and i will <\s>
<s> old jolyon asked again have you seen him <\s>
<s> his glance seemed to pierce right through the girl's eyes into her soul <\s>
<s> again june answered no he was not there <\s>
<s> i waited but he did not come <\s>
<s> old jolyon made a movement of relief <\s>
<s> she had risen and looked down at him so slight and light and young but so fixed and so determined and disturbed vexed as he was he could not frown away that fixed look <\s>
<s> the feeling of being beaten of the reins having slipped of being old and tired mastered him <\s>
<s> he said at last you'll get yourself into a mess one of these days i can see <\s>
<s> you want your own way in everything <\s>
<s> visited by one of his strange bursts of philosophy he added like that you were born and like that you'll stay until you die <\s>
<s> and he who in his dealings with men of business with boards with forsytes of all descriptions with such as were not forsytes had always had his own way looked at his indomitable grandchild sadly for he felt in her that quality which above all others he unconsciously admired <\s>
<s> do you know what they say is going on <\s>
<s> i know and i don't know i don't care <\s>
<s> and she stamped her foot <\s>
<s> i believe said old jolyon dropping his eyes that you'd have him if he were dead <\s>
<s> there was a long silence before he spoke again <\s>
<s> but as to buying this house you don't know what you're talking about <\s>
<s> june said that she did <\s>
<s> she knew that he could get it if he wanted <\s>
<s> he would only have to give what it cost <\s>
<s> you know nothing about it <\s>
<s> i won't go to soames i'll have nothing more to do with that young man <\s>
<s> but you needn't you can go to uncle james <\s>
<s> if you can't buy the house will you pay his lawsuit claim <\s>
<s> i know he is terribly hard up i've seen it <\s>
<s> you can stop it out of my money <\s>
<s> a twinkle came into old jolyon's eyes <\s>
<s> stop it out of your money <\s>
<s> and what will you do pray without your money <\s>
<s> but secretly the idea of wresting the house from james and his son had begun to take hold of him <\s>
<s> he had heard on forsyte change much comment much rather doubtful praise of this house <\s>
<s> it was too artistic but a fine place <\s>
<s> to take from the man of property that on which he had set his heart would be a crowning triumph over james practical proof that he was going to make a man of property of jo to put him back in his proper position and there to keep him secure <\s>
<s> justice once for all on those who had chosen to regard his son as a poor penniless outcast <\s>
<s> he would see he would see <\s>
<s> it might be out of the question he was not going to pay a fancy price but if it could be done why perhaps he would do it <\s>
<s> and still more secretly he knew that he could not refuse her <\s>
<s> but he did not commit himself <\s>
<s> he would think it over he said to june <\s>
<s> chapter viii bosinney's departure old jolyon was not given to hasty decisions it is probable that he would have continued to think over the purchase of the house at robin hill had not june's face told him that he would have no peace until he acted <\s>
<s> at breakfast next morning she asked him what time she should order the carriage <\s>
<s> he said with some appearance of innocence what for <\s>
<s> i'm not going out <\s>
<s> she answered if you don't go early you won't catch uncle james before he goes into the city <\s>
<s> what about your uncle james <\s>
<s> the house she replied in such a voice that he no longer pretended ignorance <\s>
