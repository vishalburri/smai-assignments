<s> i forgave you as soon as i saw how the land really lay <\s>

<s> she drew a deep breath <\s>
<s> i never regretted i couldn't <\s>
<s> did you ever love very deeply uncle jolyon <\s>
<s> at that strange question old jolyon stared before him <\s>
<s> he did not seem to remember that he ever had <\s>
<s> but he did not like to say this to the young woman whose hand was touching his arm whose life was suspended as it were by memory of a tragic love <\s>
<s> and he thought if i had met you when i was young i i might have made a fool of myself perhaps <\s>
<s> and a longing to escape in generalities beset him <\s>

<s> and he said ah <\s>
<s> there was a bit of the sculptor in him i fancy <\s>
<s> he loved balance and symmetry he loved the whole hearted way the greeks gave themselves to art <\s>
<s> the chap had no balance at all if he remembered as for symmetry clean built enough he was no doubt but those queer eyes of his and high cheek bones symmetry <\s>
<s> you're of the golden age too uncle jolyon <\s>
<s> old jolyon looked round at her <\s>
<s> was she chaffing him <\s>
<s> no her eyes were soft as velvet <\s>
<s> was she flattering him <\s>
<s> but if so why <\s>
<s> there was nothing to be had out of an old chap like him <\s>
<s> he used to say but i can never tell him that i admire him ah <\s>
<s> there it was again <\s>
<s> her dead lover her desire to talk of him <\s>
<s> and he pressed her arm half resentful of those memories half grateful as if he recognised what a link they were between herself and him <\s>
<s> he was a very talented young fellow he murmured <\s>
<s> it's hot i feel the heat nowadays <\s>
<s> for balthasar feeling that she was about to leave was rubbing his side against her leg <\s>
<s> going out under the porch with her he said he'll get you up in an hour and a quarter <\s>
<s> take this for your protegees and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand <\s>
<s> he saw her brightened eyes and heard her murmur oh <\s>
<s> and a real throb of pleasure went through him <\s>
<s> that meant one or two poor creatures helped a little and it meant that she would come again <\s>
<s> he put his hand in at the window and grasped hers once more <\s>
<s> the carriage rolled away <\s>
<s> he stood looking at the moon and the shadows of the trees and thought a sweet night <\s>
<s> ii two days of rain and summer set in bland and sunny <\s>
<s> old jolyon walked and talked with holly <\s>
<s> at first he felt taller and full of a new vigour then he felt restless <\s>
<s> almost every afternoon they would enter the coppice and walk as far as the log <\s>
<s> well she's not there <\s>
<s> he would think of course not <\s>
<s> and he would feel a little shorter and drag his feet walking up the hill home with his hand clapped to his left side <\s>
<s> now and then the thought would move in him did she come or did i dream it <\s>
<s> and he would stare at space while the dog balthasar stared at him <\s>
<s> of course she would not come again <\s>
<s> he opened the letters from spain with less excitement <\s>
<s> they were not returning till july he felt oddly that he could bear it <\s>
<s> every day at dinner he screwed up his eyes and looked at where she had sat <\s>
<s> she was not there so he unscrewed his eyes again <\s>
<s> on the seventh afternoon he thought i must go up and get some boots <\s>
<s> he ordered beacon and set out <\s>
<s> passing from putney towards hyde park he reflected i might as well go to chelsea and see her <\s>
<s> and he called out just drive me to where you took that lady the other night <\s>
<s> the coachman turned his broad red face and his juicy lips answered the lady in grey sir <\s>
<s> yes the lady in grey <\s>
<s> what other ladies were there <\s>
<s> the carriage stopped before a small three storied block of flats standing a little back from the river <\s>
<s> with a practised eye old jolyon saw that they were cheap <\s>
<s> i should think about sixty pound a year he mused and entering he looked at the name board <\s>
<s> the name forsyte was not on it but against first floor flat c were the words mrs <\s>
<s> she had taken her maiden name again <\s>
<s> and somehow this pleased him <\s>
<s> he went upstairs slowly feeling his side a little <\s>
<s> he stood a moment before ringing to lose the feeling of drag and fluttering there <\s>
<s> she would not be in <\s>
<s> the thought was black <\s>
<s> what did he want with boots at his age <\s>
<s> he could not wear out all those he had <\s>
<s> your mistress at home <\s>
<s> yes sir will you come this way <\s>
<s> old jolyon followed a very little maid not more than sixteen one would say into a very small drawing room where the sun blinds were drawn <\s>
<s> it held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and good taste <\s>
<s> he stood in the middle with his top hat in his hand and thought i expect she's very badly off <\s>
<s> there was a mirror above the fireplace and he saw himself reflected <\s>
<s> he heard a rustle and turned round <\s>
<s> she was so close that his moustache almost brushed her forehead just under her hair <\s>
<s> i was driving up he said <\s>
<s> thought i'd look in on you and ask you how you got up the other night <\s>
<s> and seeing her smile he felt suddenly relieved <\s>
<s> she was really glad to see him perhaps <\s>
<s> would you like to put on your hat and come for a drive in the park <\s>
<s> but while she was gone to put her hat on he frowned <\s>
<s> nicholas or some other member of his precious family would be there very likely prancing up and down <\s>
<s> and they would go and wag their tongues about having seen him with her afterwards <\s>
<s> he did not wish to revive the echoes of the past on forsyte change <\s>
<s> he removed a white hair from the lapel of his closely buttoned up frock coat and passed his hand over his cheeks moustache and square chin <\s>
<s> it felt very hollow there under the cheekbones <\s>
<s> he had not been eating much lately he had better get that little whippersnapper who attended holly to give him a tonic <\s>
<s> but she had come back and when they were in the carriage he said suppose we go and sit in kensington gardens instead <\s>
<s> and added with a twinkle no prancing up and down there as if she had been in the secret of his thoughts <\s>
<s> leaving the carriage they entered those select precincts and strolled towards the water <\s>
