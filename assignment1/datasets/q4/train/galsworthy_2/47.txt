<s> it was that great grey cat <\s>
<s> young bosinney was like a great cat <\s>
<s> it was him in there that she that she was he's got her still <\s>
<s> he walked to the edge of the terrace and looked down into the darkness he could just see the powdering of the daisies on the unmown lawn <\s>

<s> and there came the moon who saw all young and old alive and dead and didn't care a dump <\s>
<s> his own turn soon <\s>

<s> how should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his well spent past <\s>
<s> in that at all events there is no agitating warmth only pale winter sunshine <\s>
<s> the shell can withstand the gentle beating of the dynamos of memory <\s>
<s> he must have had a sort of fainting fit for he came to himself feeling very queer and with some difficulty rose and rang the bell <\s>
<s> it was past seven <\s>
<s> and there he was and she would be waiting <\s>
<s> but suddenly the dizziness came on again and he was obliged to relapse on the sofa <\s>
<s> he heard the maid's voice say did you ring sir <\s>
<s> yes come here he could not see her clearly for the cloud in front of his eyes <\s>
<s> i'm not well i want some sal volatile <\s>
<s> her voice sounded frightened <\s>
<s> old jolyon made an effort <\s>
<s> take this message to my niece a lady waiting in the hall a lady in grey <\s>
<s> forsyte is not well the heat <\s>
<s> he is very sorry if he is not down directly she is not to wait dinner <\s>
<s> when she was gone he thought feebly why did i say a lady in grey she may be in anything <\s>
<s> he did not go off again yet was not conscious of how irene came to be standing beside him holding smelling salts to his nose and pushing a pillow up behind his head <\s>
<s> he heard her say anxiously dear uncle jolyon what is it <\s>
<s> was dimly conscious of the soft pressure of her lips on his hand then drew a long breath of smelling salts suddenly discovered strength in them and sneezed <\s>
<s> he said it's nothing <\s>
<s> how did you get here <\s>
<s> go down and dine the tickets are on the dressing table <\s>
<s> i shall be all right in a minute <\s>
<s> he felt her cool hand on his forehead smelled violets and sat divided between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all right <\s>
<s> you are in grey <\s>
<s> once on his feet he gave himself a shake <\s>
<s> what business had i to go off like that <\s>
<s> and he moved very slowly to the glass <\s>
<s> what a cadaverous chap <\s>
<s> her voice behind him murmured you mustn't come down uncle you must rest <\s>
<s> a glass of champagne'll soon set me to rights <\s>
<s> i can't have you missing the opera <\s>
<s> but the journey down the corridor was troublesome <\s>
<s> what carpets they had in these newfangled places so thick that you tripped up in them at every step <\s>
<s> in the lift he noticed how concerned she looked and said with the ghost of a twinkle i'm a pretty host <\s>
<s> when the lift stopped he had to hold firmly to the seat to prevent its slipping under him but after soup and a glass of champagne he felt much better and began to enjoy an infirmity which had brought such solicitude into her manner towards him <\s>
<s> i should have liked you for a daughter he said suddenly and watching the smile in her eyes went on you mustn't get wrapped up in the past at your time of life plenty of that when you get to my age <\s>
<s> that's a nice dress i like the style <\s>
<s> i made it myself <\s>
<s> a woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost her interest in life <\s>
<s> make hay while the sun shines he said and drink that up <\s>
<s> i want to see some colour in your cheeks <\s>
