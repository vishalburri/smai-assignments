<s> i suppose you're comfortably off now <\s>
<s> why didn't you let me provide for you <\s>
<s> i would have in spite of everything <\s>
<s> a faint smile came on her lips but she did not answer <\s>
<s> you are still my wife said soames <\s>
<s> why he said that what he meant by it he knew neither when he spoke nor after <\s>
<s> it was a truism almost preposterous but its effect was startling <\s>
<s> she rose from the window seat and stood for a moment perfectly still looking at him <\s>
<s> he could see her bosom heaving <\s>
<s> then she turned to the window and threw it open <\s>
<s> you'll catch cold in that dress <\s>
<s> and he uttered a little sad laugh <\s>
<s> she echoed it faintly bitterly <\s>
<s> rather odd habit said soames as bitterly <\s>
<s> she shut it and sat down again <\s>
<s> she had developed power this woman this wife of his <\s>
<s> he felt it issuing from her as she sat there in a sort of armour <\s>
<s> and almost unconsciously he rose and moved nearer he wanted to see the expression on her face <\s>
<s> her eyes met his unflinching <\s>
<s> how clear they were and what a dark brown against that white skin and that burnt amber hair <\s>
<s> and how white her shoulders <\s>
<s> he ought to hate her <\s>
<s> you had better tell me he said it's to your advantage to be free as well as to mine <\s>
<s> that old matter is too old <\s>
<s> i have told you <\s>
<s> do you mean to tell me there has been nothing nobody <\s>
<s> you must go to your own life <\s>
<s> stung by that retort soames moved towards the piano and back to the hearth to and fro as he had been wont in the old days in their drawing room when his feelings were too much for him <\s>
<s> that won't do he said <\s>
<s> in common justice it's for you .... <\s>
<s> to know what was in her mind <\s>
<s> the french they were like cats one could tell nothing <\s>
<s> what a perfect young thing to hold in one's arms <\s>
<s> what a mother for his heir <\s>
<s> and he thought with a smile of his family and their surprise at a french wife and their curiosity and of the way he would play with it and buffet it confound them <\s>
<s> the poplars sighed in the darkness an owl hooted <\s>
<s> shadows deepened in the water <\s>
<s> i will and must be free he thought <\s>
<s> i won't hang about any longer <\s>
<s> i'll go and see irene <\s>
<s> if you want things done do them yourself <\s>
<s> i must live again live and move and have my being <\s>
<s> and in echo to that queer biblicality church bells chimed the call to evening prayer <\s>
<s> chapter xi and visits the past on a tuesday evening after dining at his club soames set out to do what required more courage and perhaps less delicacy than anything he had yet undertaken in his life save perhaps his birth and one other action <\s>
<s> he chose the evening indeed partly because irene was more likely to be in but mainly because he had failed to find sufficient resolution by daylight had needed wine to give him extra daring <\s>
<s> he left his hansom on the embankment and walked up to the old church uncertain of the block of flats where he knew she lived <\s>
<s> he found it hiding behind a much larger mansion and having read the name mrs <\s>
<s> her maiden name so she used that again did she he stepped back into the road to look up at the windows of the first floor <\s>
<s> light was coming through in the corner flat and he could hear a piano being played <\s>
<s> he had never had a love of music had secretly borne it a grudge in the old days when so often she had turned to her piano making of it a refuge place into which she knew he could not enter <\s>
<s> the long repulse at first restrained and secret at last open <\s>
<s> bitter memory came with that sound <\s>
<s> it must be she playing and thus almost assured of seeing her he stood more undecided than ever <\s>
<s> shivers of anticipation ran through him his tongue felt dry his heart beat fast <\s>
<s> i have no cause to be afraid he thought <\s>
<s> and then the lawyer stirred within him <\s>
<s> was he doing a foolish thing <\s>
<s> ought he not to have arranged a formal meeting in the presence of her trustee <\s>
<s> not before that fellow jolyon who sympathised with her <\s>
<s> he crossed back into the doorway and slowly to keep down the beating of his heart mounted the single flight of stairs and rang the bell <\s>
<s> when the door was opened to him his sensations were regulated by the scent which came that perfume from away back in the past bringing muffled remembrance fragrance of a drawing room he used to enter of a house he used to own perfume of dried rose leaves and honey <\s>
<s> forsyte he said your mistress will see me i know <\s>
<s> he had thought this out she would think it was jolyon <\s>
<s> when the maid was gone and he was alone in the tiny hall where the light was dim from one pearly shaded sconce and walls carpet everything was silvery making the walled in space all ghostly he could only think ridiculously shall i go in with my overcoat on or take it off <\s>
<s> the music ceased the maid said from the doorway will you walk in sir <\s>
<s> he noted mechanically that all was still silvery and that the upright piano was of satinwood <\s>
<s> she had risen and stood recoiled against it her hand placed on the keys as if groping for support had struck a sudden discord held for a moment and released <\s>
<s> the light from the shaded piano candle fell on her neck leaving her face rather in shadow <\s>
<s> she was in a black evening dress with a sort of mantilla over her shoulders he did not remember ever having seen her in black and the thought passed through him she dresses even when she's alone <\s>
<s> he heard her whisper <\s>
<s> many times soames had rehearsed this scene in fancy <\s>
<s> rehearsal served him not at all <\s>
<s> he simply could not speak <\s>
<s> he had never thought that the sight of this woman whom he had once so passionately desired so completely owned and whom he had not seen for twelve years could affect him in this way <\s>
<s> he had imagined himself speaking and acting half as man of business half as judge <\s>
<s> and now it was as if he were in the presence not of a mere woman and erring wife but of some force subtle and elusive as atmosphere itself within him and outside <\s>
<s> a kind of defensive irony welled up in him <\s>
<s> yes it's a queer visit <\s>
<s> i hope you're well <\s>
<s> will you sit down <\s>
<s> she had moved away from the piano and gone over to a window seat sinking on to it with her hands clasped in her lap <\s>
<s> light fell on her there so that soames could see her face eyes hair strangely as he remembered them strangely beautiful <\s>
<s> he sat down on the edge of a satinwood chair upholstered with silver coloured stuff close to where he was standing <\s>
<s> you have not changed he said <\s>
<s> what have you come for <\s>
<s> i have heard what you want from your cousin <\s>
<s> i have always been <\s>
<s> the sound of her voice reserved and close the sight of her figure watchfully poised defensive was helping him now <\s>
<s> a thousand memories of her ever on the watch against him stirred and .... <\s>
<s> perhaps you will be good enough then to give me information on which i can act <\s>
<s> the law must be complied with <\s>
<s> i have none to give you that you don't know of <\s>
<s> do you suppose i can believe that <\s>
<s> i don't suppose you will believe anything i say but it's the truth <\s>
<s> soames looked at her hard <\s>
<s> he had said that she had not changed now he perceived that she had <\s>
<s> not in face except that it was more beautiful not in form except that it was a little fuller no <\s>
<s> she had changed spiritually <\s>
<s> there was more of her as it were something of activity and daring where there had been sheer passive resistance <\s>
