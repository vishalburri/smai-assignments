<s> he tiptoed on and passed out into the dark passage reached his room undressed at once and stood before a mirror in his night shirt <\s>
<s> what a scarecrow with temples fallen in and thin legs <\s>
<s> his eyes resisted his own image and a look of pride came on his face <\s>
<s> all was in league to pull him down even his reflection in the glass but he was not down yet <\s>
<s> he got into bed and lay a long time without sleeping trying to reach resignation only too well aware that fretting and disappointment were very bad for him <\s>
<s> he woke in the morning so unrefreshed and strengthless that he sent for the doctor <\s>
<s> after sounding him the fellow pulled a face as long as your arm and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking <\s>
<s> that was no hardship there was nothing to get up for and when he felt ill tobacco always lost its savour <\s>
<s> he spent the morning languidly with the sun blinds down turning and re turning the times not reading much the dog balthasar lying beside his bed <\s>
<s> with his lunch they brought him a telegram running thus your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with you at four thirty <\s>
<s> then she did exist and he was not deserted <\s>
<s> a glow ran through his limbs his cheeks and forehead felt hot <\s>
<s> he drank his soup and pushed the tray table away lying very quiet until they had removed lunch and left him alone but every now and then his eyes twinkled <\s>
<s> his heart beat fast and then did not seem to beat at all <\s>
<s> at three o'clock he got up and dressed deliberately noiselessly <\s>
<s> holly and mam'zelle would be in the schoolroom and the servants asleep after their dinner he shouldn't wonder <\s>
<s> he opened his door cautiously and went downstairs <\s>
<s> in the hall the dog balthasar lay solitary and followed by him old jolyon passed into his study and out into the burning afternoon <\s>
<s> he meant to go down and meet her in the coppice but felt at once he could not manage that in this heat <\s>
<s> he sat down instead under the oak tree by the swing and the dog balthasar who also felt the heat lay down beside him <\s>
<s> he sat there smiling <\s>
<s> what a revel of bright minutes <\s>
<s> what a hum of insects and cooing of pigeons <\s>
<s> it was the quintessence of a summer day <\s>
<s> and he was happy happy as a sand boy whatever that might be <\s>
<s> she was coming she had not given him up <\s>
<s> he had everything in life he wanted except a little more breath and less weight just here <\s>
<s> he would see her when she emerged from the fernery come swaying just a little a violet grey figure passing over the daisies and dandelions and soldiers on the lawn the soldiers with their flowery crowns <\s>
<s> he would not move but she would come up to him and say dear uncle jolyon i am sorry <\s>
<s> and sit in the swing and let him look at her and tell her that he had not been very well but was all right now and that dog would lick her hand <\s>
<s> that dog knew his master was fond of her that dog was a good dog <\s>
<s> it was quite shady under the tree the sun could not get at him only make the rest of the world bright so that he could see the grand stand at epsom away out there very far and the cows cropping the clover in the field and swishing at the flies with their tails <\s>
<s> he smelled the scent of limes and lavender <\s>
<s> that was why there was such a racket of bees <\s>
<s> they were excited busy as his heart was busy and excited <\s>
<s> drowsy too drowsy and drugged on honey and happiness as his heart was drugged and drowsy <\s>
<s> summer summer they seemed saying great bees and little bees and the flies too <\s>
<s> the stable clock struck four in half an hour she would be here <\s>
<s> he would have just one tiny nap because he had had so little sleep of late and then he would be fresh for her fresh for youth and beauty coming towards him across the sunlit lawn lady in grey <\s>
<s> and settling back in his chair he closed his eyes <\s>
<s> some thistle down came on what little air there was and pitched on his moustache more white than itself <\s>
<s> he did not know but his breathing stirred it caught there <\s>
<s> a ray of sunlight struck through and lodged on his boot <\s>
<s> a bumble bee alighted and strolled on the crown of his panama hat <\s>
<s> and the delicious surge of slumber reached the brain beneath that hat and the head swayed forward and rested on his breast <\s>
<s> so went the hum <\s>
<s> the stable clock struck the quarter past <\s>
<s> the dog balthasar stretched and looked up at his master <\s>
<s> the thistledown no longer moved <\s>
<s> the dog placed his chin over the sunlit foot <\s>
<s> it did not stir <\s>
<s> the dog withdrew his chin quickly rose and leaped on old jolyon's lap looked in his face whined then leaping down sat on his haunches gazing up <\s>
<s> and suddenly he uttered a long long howl <\s>
<s> but the thistledown was still as death and the face of his old master <\s>
<s> the soundless footsteps on the grass <\s>
<s> 1917 in chancery two households both alike in dignity from ancient grudge break into new mutiny <\s>
<s> romeo and juliet to jessie and joseph conrad part 1 chapter i at timothy's the possessive instinct never stands still <\s>
<s> through florescence and feud frosts and fires it followed the laws of progression even in the forsyte family which had believed it fixed for ever <\s>
<s> nor can it be dissociated from environment any more than the quality of potato from the soil <\s>
<s> the historian of the english eighties and nineties will in his good time depict the somewhat rapid progression from self contented and contained provincialism to still more self contented if less contained imperialism in other words the possessive instinct of the nation on the move <\s>
<s> and so as if in conformity was it with the forsyte family <\s>
<s> they were spreading not merely on the surface but within <\s>
<s> when in 1895 susan hayman the married forsyte sister followed her husband at the ludicrously low age of seventy four and was cremated it made strangely little stir among the six old forsytes left <\s>
<s> for this apathy there were three causes <\s>
<s> first the almost surreptitious burial of old jolyon in 1892 down at robin hill first of the forsytes to desert the family grave at highgate <\s>
<s> that burial coming a year after swithin's entirely proper funeral had occasioned a great deal of talk on forsyte change the abode of timothy forsyte on the bayswater road london which still collected and radiated family gossip <\s>
<s> opinions ranged from the lamentation of aunt juley to the outspoken assertion of francie that it was a jolly good thing to stop all that stuffy highgate business <\s>
<s> uncle jolyon in his later years indeed ever since the strange and lamentable affair between his granddaughter june's lover young bosinney and irene his nephew soames forsyte's wife had noticeably rapped the family's knuckles and that way of his own which he had always taken had begun to seem to them a little wayward <\s>
<s> the philosophic vein in him of course had always been too liable to crop out of the strata of pure forsyteism so they were in a way prepared for his interment in a strange spot <\s>
<s> but the whole thing was an odd business and when the contents of his will became current coin on forsyte change a shiver had gone round the clan <\s>
<s> out of his estate l145 304 gross with liabilities l35 7s <\s>
<s> 4d he had actually left l15 000 to whomever do you think my dear <\s>
<s> that runaway wife of his nephew soames irene a woman who had almost disgraced the family and still more amazing was to him no blood relation <\s>
<s> not out and out of course only a life interest only the income from it <\s>
<s> still there it was and old jolyon's claim to be the perfect forsyte was ended once for all <\s>
<s> that then was the first reason why the burial of susan hayman at woking made little stir <\s>
<s> the second reason was altogether more expansive and imperial <\s>
<s> besides the house on campden hill susan had a place left her by hayman when he died just over the border in hants where the hayman boys had learned to be such good shots and riders as it was believed which was of course nice for them and creditable to everybody and the fact of owning something really countrified seemed somehow to excuse the dispersion of her remains though what could have put cremation into her head they could not think <\s>
<s> the usual invitations however had been issued and soames had gone down and young nicholas and the will had been quite satisfactory so far as it went for she had only had a life interest and everything had gone quite smoothly to the children in equal shares <\s>
<s> the third reason why susan's burial made little stir was the most expansive of all <\s>
<s> it was summed up daringly by euphemia the pale the thin well i think people have a right to their own bodies even when they're dead <\s>
<s> coming from a daughter of nicholas a liberal of the old school and most tyrannical it was a startling remark showing in a flash what a lot of water had run under bridges since the death of aunt ann in 86 just when the proprietorship of soames over his wife's body was acquiring the uncertainty which had led to such disaster <\s>
