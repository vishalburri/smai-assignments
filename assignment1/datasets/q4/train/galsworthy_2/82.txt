<s> at the end of july on the afternoon before the case he went in to see her <\s>
<s> they had not yet been able to leave town because dartie had already spent their summer holiday and winifred dared not go to her father for more money while he was waiting not to be told anything about this affair of soames <\s>
<s> soames found her with a letter in her hand <\s>
<s> that from val he asked gloomily <\s>
<s> what does he say <\s>
<s> he says he's married said winifred <\s>
<s> whom to for goodness sake <\s>
<s> winifred looked up at him <\s>
<s> to holly forsyte jolyon's daughter <\s>
<s> he got leave and did it <\s>
<s> i didn't even know he knew her <\s>
<s> soames uttered a short laugh at that characteristic minimisation <\s>
<s> well i don't suppose they'll hear about this till they come back <\s>
<s> they'd better stay out there <\s>
<s> that fellow will give her money <\s>
<s> but i want val back said winifred almost piteously i miss him he helps me to get on <\s>
<s> i know murmured soames <\s>
<s> how's dartie behaving now <\s>
<s> it might be worse but it's always money <\s>
<s> would you like me to come down to the court to morrow soames <\s>
<s> soames stretched out his hand for hers <\s>
<s> the gesture so betrayed the loneliness in him that she pressed it between her two <\s>
<s> never mind old boy <\s>
<s> you'll feel ever so much better when it's all over <\s>
<s> i don't know what i've done said soames huskily i never have <\s>
<s> it's all upside down <\s>
<s> i was fond of her i've always been <\s>
<s> winifred saw a drop of blood ooze out of his lip and the sight stirred her profoundly <\s>
<s> of course she said it's been too bad of her all along <\s>
<s> but what shall i do about this marriage of val's soames <\s>
<s> i don't know how to write to him with this coming on <\s>
<s> you've seen that child <\s>
<s> yes she's pretty said soames <\s>
<s> that doesn't sound so bad thought winifred <\s>
<s> it is a coil she said <\s>
<s> what will father say <\s>
<s> mustn't be told said soames <\s>
<s> the war'll soon be over now you'd better let val take to farming out there <\s>
<s> it was tantamount to saying that his nephew was lost <\s>
<s> i haven't told monty winifred murmured desolately <\s>
<s> the case was reached before noon next day and was over in little more than half an hour <\s>
<s> soames pale spruce sad eyed in the witness box had suffered so much beforehand that he took it all like one dead <\s>
<s> the moment the decree nisi was pronounced he left the courts of justice <\s>
<s> four hours until he became public property <\s>
<s> a surly dogged anger replaced that dead feeling within him <\s>
<s> he thought i won't run away <\s>
<s> i'll act as if nothing had happened <\s>
<s> and in the sweltering heat of fleet street and ludgate hill he walked all the way to his city club lunched and went back to his office <\s>
<s> he worked there stolidly throughout the afternoon <\s>
<s> on his way out he saw that his clerks knew and answered their involuntary glances with a look so sardonic that they were immediately withdrawn <\s>
<s> in front of st <\s>
<s> paul's he stopped to buy the most gentlemanly of the evening papers <\s>
<s> damages given to the blind' so they had got that in <\s>
<s> at every other face he thought i wonder if you know <\s>
<s> and suddenly he felt queer as if something were racing round in his head <\s>
<s> he was letting it get hold of him <\s>
<s> he would be ill <\s>
<s> he would get down to the river and row about and fish <\s>
<s> i'm not going to be laid up he thought <\s>
<s> it flashed across him that he had something of importance to do before he went out of town <\s>
<s> he must explain the law <\s>
<s> another six months before he was really free <\s>
<s> only he did not want to see annette <\s>
<s> and he passed his hand over the top of his head it was very hot <\s>
<s> he branched off through covent garden <\s>
<s> on this sultry day of late july the garbage tainted air of the old market offended him and soho seemed more than ever the disenchanted home of rapscallionism <\s>
<s> alone the restaurant bretagne neat daintily painted with its blue tubs and the dwarf trees therein retained an aloof and frenchified self respect <\s>
<s> it was the slack hour and pale trim waitresses were preparing the little tables for dinner <\s>
<s> soames went through into the private part <\s>
<s> to his discomfiture annette answered his knock <\s>
<s> she too looked pale and dragged down by the heat <\s>
<s> you are quite a stranger she said languidly <\s>
<s> i haven't wished to be i've been busy <\s>
<s> where's your mother annette <\s>
<s> i've got some news for her <\s>
<s> mother is not in <\s>
<s> it seemed to soames that she looked at him in a queer way <\s>
<s> what did she know <\s>
<s> how much had her mother told her <\s>
<s> the worry of trying to make that out gave him an alarming feeling in the head <\s>
<s> he gripped the edge of the table and dizzily saw annette come forward her eyes clear with surprise <\s>
<s> he shut his own and said it's all right <\s>
<s> i've had a touch of the sun i think <\s>
<s> what he had was a touch of darkness <\s>
<s> annette's voice french and composed said sit down it will pass then <\s>
<s> her hand pressed his shoulder and soames sank into a chair <\s>
<s> when the dark feeling dispersed and he opened his eyes she was looking down at him <\s>
<s> what an inscrutable and odd expression for a girl of twenty <\s>
<s> do you feel better <\s>
<s> it's nothing said soames <\s>
<s> instinct told him that to be feeble before her was not helping him age was enough handicap without that <\s>
<s> will power was his fortune with annette he had lost ground these latter months from indecision he could not afford to lose any more <\s>
<s> he got up and said i'll write to your mother <\s>
<s> i'm going down to my river house for a long holiday <\s>
<s> i want you both to come there presently and stay <\s>
<s> it's just at its best <\s>
