<s> his eyes reconcentrated themselves quickly on the buttonhook and as if in apology james hurried on i don't know what's become of her they say she's abroad <\s>
<s> your uncle swithin used to admire her he was a funny fellow <\s>
<s> so he always alluded to his dead twin 'the stout and the lean of it they had been called she wouldn't be alone i should say <\s>
<s> and with that summing up of the effect of beauty on human nature he was silent watching his son with eyes doubting as a bird's <\s>
<s> soames too was silent <\s>
<s> whish whish went the brushes <\s>
<s> said james and the word came from deep down but there's all my money and there's his who's it to go to <\s>
<s> and when he dies the name goes out <\s>
<s> soames replaced the button hook on the lace and pink silk of the dressing table coverlet <\s>
<s> said emily there are all the other forsytes <\s>
<s> as if that helped me muttered james <\s>
<s> i shall be in my grave and there'll be nobody unless he marries again <\s>
<s> you're quite right said soames quietly i'm getting a divorce <\s>
<s> james eyes almost started from his head <\s>
<s> nobody tells me anything <\s>
<s> well said emily who would have imagined you wanted it <\s>
<s> my dear boy that is a surprise after all these years <\s>
<s> it'll be a scandal muttered james as if to himself but i can't help that <\s>
<s> don't brush so hard <\s>
<s> when'll it come on <\s>
<s> before the long vacation it's not defended <\s>
<s> james lips moved in secret calculation <\s>
<s> i shan't live to see my grandson he muttered <\s>
<s> of course you will james <\s>
<s> soames will be as quick as he can <\s>
<s> there was a long silence till james reached out his arm <\s>
<s> let's have the eau de cologne and putting it to his nose he moved his forehead in the direction of his son <\s>
<s> soames bent over and kissed that brow just where the hair began <\s>
<s> a relaxing quiver passed over james face as though the wheels of anxiety within were running down <\s>
<s> i'll get to bed he said i shan't want to see the papers when that comes <\s>
<s> they're a morbid lot i can't pay attention to them i'm too old <\s>
<s> queerly affected soames went to the door he heard his father say here i'm tired <\s>
<s> i'll say a prayer in bed <\s>
<s> and his mother answering that's right james it'll be ever so much more comfy <\s>
<s> chapter ix out of the web on forsyte change the announcement of jolly's death among a batch of troopers caused mixed sensation <\s>
<s> strange to read that jolyon forsyte fifth of the name in direct descent had died of disease in the service of his country and not be able to feel it personally <\s>
<s> it revived the old grudge against his father for having estranged himself <\s>
<s> for such was still the prestige of old jolyon that the other forsytes could never quite feel as might have been expected that it was they who had cut off his descendants for irregularity <\s>
<s> the news increased of course the interest and anxiety about val but then val's name was dartie and even if he were killed in battle or got the victoria cross it would not be at all the same as if his name were forsyte <\s>
<s> not even casualty or glory to the haymans would be really satisfactory <\s>
<s> family pride felt defrauded <\s>
<s> how the rumour arose then that something very dreadful my dear was pending no one least of all soames could tell secret as he kept everything <\s>
<s> possibly some eye had seen forsyte v <\s>
<s> forsyte and forsyte in the cause list and had added it to irene in paris with a fair beard <\s>
<s> possibly some wall at park lane had ears <\s>
<s> the fact remained that it was known whispered among the old discussed among the young that family pride must soon receive a blow <\s>
<s> soames paying one of his sunday visits to timothy's paying it with the feeling that after the suit came on he would be paying no more felt knowledge in the air as he came in <\s>
<s> nobody of course dared speak of it before him but each of the four other forsytes present held their breath aware that nothing could prevent aunt juley from making them all uncomfortable <\s>
<s> she looked so piteously at soames she checked herself on the point of speech so often that aunt hester excused herself and said she must go and bathe timothy's eye he had a sty coming <\s>
<s> soames impassive slightly supercilious did not stay long <\s>
<s> he went out with a curse stifled behind his pale just smiling lips <\s>
<s> fortunately for the peace of his mind cruelly tortured by the coming scandal he was kept busy day and night with plans for his retirement for he had come to that grim conclusion <\s>
<s> to go on seeing all those people who had known him as a long headed chap an astute adviser after that no <\s>
<s> the fastidiousness and pride which was so strangely so inextricably blended in him with possessive obtuseness revolted against the thought <\s>
<s> he would retire live privately go on buying pictures make a great name as a collector after all his heart was more in that than it had ever been in law <\s>
<s> in pursuance of this now fixed resolve he had to get ready to amalgamate his business with another firm without letting people know for that would excite curiosity and make humiliation cast its shadow before <\s>
<s> he had pitched on the firm of cuthcott holliday and kingson two of whom were dead <\s>
<s> the full name after the amalgamation would therefore be cuthcott holliday kingson forsyte bustard and forsyte <\s>
<s> but after debate as to which of the dead still had any influence with the living it was decided to reduce the title to cuthcott kingson and forsyte of whom kingson would be the active and soames the sleeping partner <\s>
<s> for leaving his name prestige and clients behind him soames would receive considerable value <\s>
<s> one night as befitted a man who had arrived at so important a stage of his career he made a calculation of what he was worth and after writing off liberally for depreciation by the war found his value to be some hundred and thirty thousand pounds <\s>
<s> at his father's death which could not alas be delayed much longer he must come into at least another fifty thousand and his yearly expenditure at present just reached two <\s>
<s> standing among his pictures he saw before him a future full of bargains earned by the trained faculty of knowing better than other people <\s>
<s> selling what was about to decline keeping what was still going up and exercising judicious insight into future taste he would make a unique collection which at his death would pass to the nation under the title forsyte bequest <\s>
<s> if the divorce went through he had determined on his line with madame lamotte <\s>
<s> she had he knew but one real ambition to live on her renter in paris near her grandchildren <\s>
<s> he would buy the goodwill of the restaurant bretagne at a fancy price <\s>
<s> madame would live like a queen mother in paris on the interest invested as she would know how <\s>
<s> incidentally soames meant to put a capable manager in her place and make the restaurant pay good interest on his money <\s>
<s> there were great possibilities in soho on annette he would promise to settle fifteen thousand pounds whether designedly or not precisely the sum old jolyon had settled on that woman <\s>
<s> a letter from jolyon's solicitor to his own had disclosed the fact that those two were in italy <\s>
<s> and an opportunity had been duly given for noting that they had first stayed at an hotel in london <\s>
<s> the matter was clear as daylight and would be disposed of in half an hour or so but during that half hour he soames would go down to hell and after that half hour all bearers of the forsyte name would feel the bloom was off the rose <\s>
<s> he had no illusions like shakespeare that roses by any other name would smell as sweet <\s>
<s> the name was a possession a concrete unstained piece of property the value of which would be reduced some twenty per cent <\s>
<s> unless it were roger who had once refused to stand for parliament and oh irony jolyon hung on the line there had never been a distinguished forsyte <\s>
<s> but that very lack of distinction was the name's greatest asset <\s>
<s> it was a private name intensely individual and his own property it had never been exploited for good or evil by intrusive report <\s>
<s> he and each member of his family owned it wholly sanely secretly without any more interference from the public than had been necessitated by their births their marriages their deaths <\s>
<s> and during these weeks of waiting and preparing to drop the law he conceived for that law a bitter distaste so deeply did he resent its coming violation of his name forced on him by the need he felt to perpetuate that name in a lawful manner <\s>
<s> the monstrous injustice of the whole thing excited in him a perpetual suppressed fury <\s>
<s> he had asked no better than to live in spotless domesticity and now he must go into the witness box after all these futile barren years and proclaim his failure to keep his wife incur the pity the amusement the contempt of his kind <\s>
<s> it was all upside down <\s>
<s> she and that fellow ought to be the sufferers and they were in italy <\s>
<s> in these weeks the law he had served so faithfully looked on so reverently as the guardian of all property seemed to him quite pitiful <\s>
<s> what could be more insane than to tell a man that he owned his wife and punish him when someone unlawfully took her away from him <\s>
<s> did the law not know that a man's name was to him the apple of his eye that it was far harder to be regarded as cuckold than as seducer <\s>
<s> he actually envied jolyon the reputation of succeeding where he soames had failed <\s>
<s> the question of damages worried him too <\s>
<s> he wanted to make that fellow suffer but he remembered his cousin's words i shall be very happy with the uneasy feeling that to claim damages would make not jolyon but himself suffer he felt uncannily that jolyon would rather like to pay them the chap was so loose <\s>
<s> besides to claim damages was not the thing to do <\s>
<s> the claim indeed had been made almost mechanically and as the hour drew near soames saw in it just another dodge of this insensitive and topsy turvy law to make him ridiculous so that people might sneer and say oh yes he got quite a good price for her <\s>
<s> and he gave instructions that his counsel should state that the money would be given to a home for fallen women <\s>
<s> he was a long time hitting off exactly the right charity but having pitched on it he used to wake up in the night and think it won't do too lurid it'll draw attention <\s>
<s> he did not care for dogs or he would have named them and it was in desperation at last for his knowledge of charities was limited that he decided on the blind <\s>
<s> that could not be inappropriate and it would make the jury assess the damages high <\s>
<s> a good many suits were dropping out of the list which happened to be exceptionally thin that summer so that his case would be reached before august <\s>
<s> as the day grew nearer winifred was his only comfort <\s>
<s> she showed the fellow feeling of one who had been through the mill and was the femme sole in whom he confided well knowing that she would not let dartie into her confidence <\s>
<s> that ruffian would be only too rejoiced <\s>
