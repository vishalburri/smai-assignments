<s> when's he going to don the wild khaki <\s>
<s> young nicholas smiling with a sort of sweet deprecation intimated that of course his mother was very anxious <\s>
<s> the dromios are off i hear said george turning to marian tweetyman we shall all be there soon <\s>
<s> en avant the forsytes <\s>
<s> roll bowl or pitch <\s>
<s> who's for a cooler <\s>
<s> aunt juley gurgled george was so droll <\s>
<s> should hester get timothy's map <\s>
<s> then he could show them all where they were <\s>
<s> at a sound from timothy interpreted as assent aunt hester left the room <\s>
<s> george pursued his image of the forsyte advance addressing timothy as field marshal and imogen whom he had noted at once for a pretty filly as vivandiere and holding his top hat between his knees he began to beat it with imaginary drumsticks <\s>
<s> the reception accorded to his fantasy was mixed <\s>
<s> all laughed george was licensed but all felt that the family was being rotted and this seemed to them unnatural now that it was going to give five of its members to the service of the queen <\s>
<s> george might go too far and there was relief when he got up offered his arm to aunt juley marched up to timothy saluted him kissed his aunt with mock passion said oh <\s>
<s> what a treat dear papa <\s>
<s> and walked out followed by the grave and fastidious eustace who had never smiled <\s>
<s> aunt juley's bewildered fancy not waiting for the map <\s>
<s> you mustn't mind him timothy <\s>
<s> broke the hush and timothy removed the hand from his mouth <\s>
<s> i don't know what things are comin to he was heard to say <\s>
<s> what's all this about goin out there <\s>
<s> that's not the way to beat those boers <\s>
<s> francie alone had the hardihood to observe what is then uncle timothy <\s>
<s> all this new fangled volunteerin and expense lettin money out of the country <\s>
<s> just then aunt hester brought in the map handling it like a baby with eruptions <\s>
<s> with the assistance of euphemia it was laid on the piano a small colwood grand last played on it was believed the summer before aunt ann died thirteen years ago <\s>
<s> he walked over to the piano and stood looking at his map while they all gathered round <\s>
<s> there you are he said that's the position up to date and very poor it is <\s>
<s> yes said francie greatly daring but how are you going to alter it uncle timothy without more men <\s>
<s> said timothy you don't want men wastin the country's money <\s>
<s> you want a napoleon he'd settle it in a month <\s>
<s> but if you haven't got him uncle timothy <\s>
<s> that's their business replied timothy <\s>
<s> what have we kept the army up for to eat their heads off in time of peace <\s>
<s> they ought to be ashamed of themselves comin on the country to help them like this <\s>
<s> let every man stick to his business and we shall get on <\s>
<s> and looking round him he added almost angrily volunteerin indeed <\s>
<s> throwin good money after bad <\s>
<s> conserve energy that's the only way <\s>
<s> and with a prolonged sound not quite a sniff and not quite a snort he trod on euphemia's toe and went out leaving a sensation and a faint scent of barley sugar behind him <\s>
<s> the effect of something said with conviction by one who has evidently made a sacrifice to say it is ever considerable <\s>
<s> and the eight forsytes left behind all women except young nicholas were silent for a moment round the map <\s>
<s> then francie said really i think he's right you know <\s>
<s> after all what is the army for <\s>
<s> they ought to have known <\s>
<s> it's only encouraging them <\s>
<s> cried aunt juley but they've been so progressive <\s>
<s> think of their giving up their scarlet <\s>
<s> they were always so proud of it <\s>
<s> and now they all look like convicts <\s>
<s> hester and i were saying only yesterday we were sure they must feel it very much <\s>
<s> fancy what the iron duke would have said <\s>
<s> the new colour's very smart said winifred val looks quite nice in his <\s>
<s> i do so wonder what jolyon's boy is like <\s>
<s> to think we've never seen him <\s>
<s> his father must be so proud of him <\s>
<s> his father's in paris said winifred <\s>
<s> aunt hester's shoulder was seen to mount suddenly as if to ward off her sister's next remark for juley's crumpled cheeks had gushed <\s>
<s> we had dear little mrs <\s>
<s> macander here yesterday just back from paris <\s>
<s> and whom d'you think she saw there in the street <\s>
<s> we shan't try auntie said euphemia <\s>
<s> after all this time walking with a fair beard .... <\s>
<s> a fair beard .... <\s>
<s> i was going to say said aunt juley severely a fair bearded gentleman <\s>
<s> and not a day older she was always so pretty she added with a sort of lingering apology <\s>
<s> tell us about her auntie cried imogen i can just remember her <\s>
<s> she's the skeleton in the family cupboard isn't she <\s>
<s> and they're such fun <\s>
<s> aunt hester sat down <\s>
<s> really juley had done it now <\s>
<s> she wasn't much of a skeleton as i remember her murmured euphemia extremely well covered <\s>
<s> said aunt juley what a peculiar way of putting it not very nice <\s>
<s> no but what was she like <\s>
<s> i'll tell you my child said francie a kind of modern venus very well dressed <\s>
<s> euphemia said sharply venus was never dressed and she had blue eyes of melting sapphire <\s>
<s> at this juncture nicholas took his leave <\s>
<s> nick is awfully strict said francie with a laugh <\s>
<s> she has six children said aunt juley it's very proper she should be careful <\s>
<s> was uncle soames awfully fond of her <\s>
<s> pursued the inexorable imogen moving her dark luscious eyes from face to face <\s>
<s> aunt hester made a gesture of despair just as aunt juley answered yes your uncle soames was very much attached to her <\s>
<s> i suppose she ran off with someone <\s>
<s> no certainly not that is not precisely <\s>
<s> what did she do then auntie <\s>
<s> come along imogen said winifred we must be getting back <\s>
<s> but aunt juley interjected resolutely she she didn't behave at all well <\s>
<s> cried imogen that's as far as i ever get <\s>
<s> well my dear said francie she had a love affair which ended with the young man's death and then she left your uncle <\s>
<s> i always rather liked her <\s>
<s> she used to give me chocolates murmured imogen and smell nice <\s>
<s> not of course at all <\s>
<s> replied francie who used a particularly expensive essence of gillyflower herself <\s>
<s> i can't think what we are about said aunt juley raising her hands talking of such things <\s>
<s> asked imogen from the door <\s>
<s> certainly not cried aunt juley that is certainly not <\s>
