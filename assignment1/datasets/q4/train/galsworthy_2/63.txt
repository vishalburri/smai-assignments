<s> i like the paddock <\s>
<s> i like to back my judgment answered val <\s>
<s> jolly smiled his smile was like his father's <\s>
<s> i haven't got any <\s>
<s> i always lose money if i bet <\s>
<s> you have to buy experience of course <\s>
<s> yes but it's all messed up with doing people in the eye <\s>
<s> of course or they'll do you that's the excitement <\s>
<s> jolly looked a little scornful <\s>
<s> what do you do with yourself <\s>
<s> no ride and drive about <\s>
<s> i'm going to play polo next term if i can get my granddad to stump up <\s>
