<s> he answered mechanically i'm all right and looked at them and it seemed impossible to bring out his news <\s>

<s> soames shook his head <\s>
<s> no he stammered she she's left me <\s>
<s> emily deserted the mirror before which she was standing <\s>
<s> her tall full figure lost its majesty and became very human as she came running over to soames <\s>
<s> she put her lips to his forehead and stroked his hand <\s>
<s> james too had turned full towards his son his face looked older <\s>
<s> what d'you mean left you <\s>
<s> you never told me she was going to leave you <\s>
<s> soames answered surlily how could i tell <\s>
<s> what's to be done <\s>
<s> james began walking up and down he looked strange and stork like without a coat <\s>
<s> what's to be done <\s>
<s> how should i know what's to be done <\s>
<s> what's the good of asking me <\s>
<s> nobody tells me anything and then they come and ask me what's to be done and i should like to know how i'm to tell them <\s>
<s> here's your mother there she stands she doesn't say anything <\s>
<s> what i should say you've got to do is to follow her .. <\s>
<s> soames smiled his peculiar supercilious smile had never before looked pitiable <\s>
<s> i don't know where she's gone he said <\s>
<s> don't know where she's gone <\s>
<s> how d'you mean don't know where she's gone <\s>
<s> where d'you suppose she's gone <\s>
<s> she's gone after that young bosinney that's where she's gone <\s>
<s> i knew how it would be <\s>
<s> soames in the long silence that followed felt his mother pressing his hand <\s>
<s> and all that passed seemed to pass as though his own power of thinking or doing had gone to sleep <\s>
<s> his father's face dusky red twitching as if he were going to cry and words breaking out that seemed rent from him by some spasm in his soul <\s>
<s> there'll be a scandal i always said so <\s>
<s> then no one saying anything and there you stand you and your mother <\s>
<s> and emily's voice calm rather contemptuous come now james <\s>
<s> soames will do all that he can <\s>
<s> and james staring at the floor a little brokenly well i can't help you i'm getting old <\s>
<s> don't you be in too great a hurry my boy <\s>
<s> and his mother's voice again soames will do all he can to get her back <\s>
<s> we won't talk of it <\s>
<s> it'll all come right i dare say <\s>
<s> and james well i can't see how it can come right <\s>
<s> and if she hasn't gone off with that young bosinney my advice to you is not to listen to her but to follow her and get her back <\s>
<s> once more soames felt his mother stroking his hand in token of her approval and as though repeating some form of sacred oath he muttered between his teeth i will <\s>
<s> all three went down to the drawing room together <\s>
<s> there were gathered the three girls and dartie had irene been present the family circle would have been complete <\s>
<s> james sank into his armchair and except for a word of cold greeting to dartie whom he both despised and dreaded as a man likely to be always in want of money he said nothing till dinner was announced <\s>
<s> soames too was silent emily alone a woman of cool courage maintained a conversation with winifred on trivial subjects <\s>
<s> she was never more composed in her manner and conversation than that evening <\s>
<s> a decision having been come to not to speak of irene's flight no view was expressed by any other member of the family as to the right course to be pursued there can be little doubt from the general tone adopted in relation to events as they afterwards turned out that james's advice don't you listen to her follow her and get her back <\s>
<s> would with here and there an exception have been regarded as sound not only in park lane but amongst the nicholases the rogers and at timothy's <\s>
<s> just as it would surely have been endorsed by that wider body of forsytes all over london who were merely excluded from judgment by ignorance of the story <\s>
<s> in spite then of emily's efforts the dinner was served by warmson and the footman almost in silence <\s>
<s> dartie was sulky and drank all he could get the girls seldom talked to each other at any time <\s>
<s> james asked once where june was and what she was doing with herself in these days <\s>
<s> no one could tell him <\s>
<s> he sank back into gloom <\s>
<s> only when winifred recounted how little publius had given his bad penny to a beggar did he brighten up <\s>
<s> he said that's a clever little chap <\s>
<s> i don't know what'll become of him if he goes on like this <\s>
<s> an intelligent little chap i call him <\s>
<s> but it was only a flash <\s>
<s> the courses succeeded one another solemnly under the electric light which glared down onto the table but barely reached the principal ornament of the walls a so called sea piece by turner almost entirely composed of cordage and drowning men <\s>
<s> champagne was handed and then a bottle of james prehistoric port but as by the chill hand of some skeleton <\s>
<s> at ten o'clock soames left twice in reply to questions he had said that irene was not well he felt he could no longer trust himself <\s>
<s> his mother kissed him with her large soft kiss and he pressed her hand a flush of warmth in his cheeks <\s>
