<s> she raised her hands to her hair which she wore a la princesse de galles and touched it here and there settling it more firmly on her head and her eyes were full of an unconscious realism as though she were looking in the face one of life's sordid facts and making the best of it <\s>
<s> in youth her cheeks had been of cream and roses but they were mottled now by middle age and again that hard ugly directness came into her eyes as she dabbed a powder puff across her forehead <\s>
<s> putting the puff down she stood quite still before the glass arranging a smile over her high important nose her chin never large and now growing smaller with the increase of her neck her thin lipped down drooping mouth <\s>
<s> quickly not to lose the effect she grasped her skirts strongly in both hands and went downstairs <\s>
<s> she had been hoping for this visit for some time past <\s>
<s> whispers had reached her that things were not all right between her nephew and his fiancee <\s>
<s> neither of them had been near her for weeks <\s>
<s> she had asked phil to dinner many times his invariable answer had been too busy <\s>
<s> her instinct was alarmed and the instinct in such matters of this excellent woman was keen <\s>
<s> she ought to have been a forsyte in young jolyon's sense of the word she certainly had that privilege and merits description as such <\s>
<s> she had married off her three daughters in a way that people said was beyond their deserts for they had the professional plainness only to be found as a rule among the female kind of the more legal callings <\s>
<s> her name was upon the committees of numberless charities connected with the church dances theatricals or bazaars and she never lent her name unless sure beforehand that everything had been thoroughly organized <\s>
<s> she believed as she often said in putting things on a commercial basis the proper function of the church of charity indeed of everything was to strengthen the fabric of society <\s>
<s> individual action therefore she considered immoral <\s>
<s> organization was the only thing for by organization alone could you feel sure that you were getting a return for your money <\s>
<s> and there is no doubt that she was what old jolyon called her a dab at that he went further he called her a humbug <\s>
<s> the enterprises to which she lent her name were organized so admirably that by the time the takings were handed over they were indeed skim milk divested of all cream of human kindness <\s>
<s> but as she often justly remarked sentiment was to be deprecated <\s>
<s> she was in fact a little academic <\s>
<s> this great and good woman so highly thought of in ecclesiastical circles was one of the principal priestesses in the temple of forsyteism keeping alive day and night a sacred flame to the god of property whose altar is inscribed with those inspiring words nothing for nothing and really remarkably little for sixpence <\s>
<s> when she entered a room it was felt that something substantial had come in which was probably the reason of her popularity as a patroness <\s>
<s> people liked something substantial when they had paid money for it and they would look at her surrounded by her staff in charity ballrooms with her high nose and her broad square figure attired in an uniform covered with sequins as though she were a general <\s>
<s> the only thing against her was that she had not a double name <\s>
<s> she was a power in upper middle class society with its hundred sets and circles all intersecting on the common battlefield of charity functions and on that battlefield brushing skirts so pleasantly with the skirts of society with the capital s <\s>
<s> she was a power in society with the smaller s that larger more significant and more powerful body where the commercially christian institutions maxims and principle which mrs <\s>
<s> baynes embodied were real life blood circulating freely real business currency not merely the sterilized imitation that flowed in the veins of smaller society with the larger s <\s>
<s> people who knew her felt her to be sound a sound woman who never gave herself away nor anything else if she could possibly help it <\s>
<s> she had been on the worst sort of terms with bosinney's father who had not infrequently made her the object of an unpardonable ridicule <\s>
<s> she alluded to him now that he was gone as her poor dear irreverend brother <\s>
<s> she greeted june with the careful effusion of which she was a mistress a little afraid of her as far as a woman of her eminence in the commercial and christian world could be afraid for so slight a girl june had a great dignity the fearlessness of her eyes gave her that <\s>
<s> baynes too shrewdly recognized that behind the uncompromising frankness of june's manner there was much of the forsyte <\s>
<s> if the girl had been merely frank and courageous mrs <\s>
<s> baynes would have thought her cranky and despised her if she had been merely a forsyte like francie let us say she would have patronized her from sheer weight of metal but june small though she was mrs <\s>
<s> baynes habitually admired quantity gave her an uneasy feeling and she placed her in a chair opposite the light <\s>
<s> there was another reason for her respect which mrs <\s>
<s> baynes too good a churchwoman to be worldly would have been the last to admit she often heard her husband describe old jolyon as extremely well off and was biassed towards his granddaughter for the soundest of all reasons <\s>
<s> to day she felt the emotion with which we read a novel describing a hero and an inheritance nervously anxious lest by some frightful lapse of the novelist the young man should be left without it at the end <\s>
<s> her manner was warm she had never seen so clearly before how distinguished and desirable a girl this was <\s>
<s> she asked after old jolyon's health <\s>
<s> a wonderful man for his age so upright and young looking and how old was he <\s>
<s> she would never have thought it <\s>
<s> they were at the sea <\s>
<s> very nice for them she supposed june heard from phil every day <\s>
<s> her light grey eyes became more prominent as she asked this question but the girl met the glance without flinching <\s>
<s> no she said he never writes <\s>
<s> baynes's eyes dropped they had no intention of doing so but they did <\s>
<s> that's phil all over he was always like that <\s>
<s> the brevity of the answer caused mrs <\s>
<s> baynes's bright smile a moment's hesitation she disguised it by a quick movement and spreading her skirts afresh said why my dear he's quite the most harum scarum person one never pays the slightest attention to what he does <\s>
<s> the conviction came suddenly to june that she was wasting her time even were she to put a question point blank she would never get anything out of this woman <\s>
<s> do you see him <\s>
<s> she asked her face crimsoning <\s>
<s> the perspiration broke out on mrs <\s>
<s> baynes forehead beneath the powder <\s>
<s> i don't remember when he was here last indeed we haven't seen much of him lately <\s>
<s> he's so busy with your cousin's house i'm told it'll be finished directly <\s>
<s> we must organize a little dinner to celebrate the event do come and stay the night with us <\s>
<s> thank you said june <\s>
<s> again she thought i'm only wasting my time <\s>
<s> this woman will tell me nothing <\s>
<s> she got up to go <\s>
<s> a change came over mrs <\s>
<s> she rose too her lips twitched she fidgeted her hands <\s>
<s> something was evidently very wrong and she did not dare to ask this girl who stood there a slim straight little figure with her decided face her set jaw and resentful eyes <\s>
<s> she was not accustomed to be afraid of asking questions all organization was based on the asking of questions <\s>
<s> but the issue was so grave that her nerve normally strong was fairly shaken only that morning her husband had said old mr <\s>
<s> forsyte must be worth well over a hundred thousand pounds <\s>
<s> and this girl stood there holding out her hand holding out her hand <\s>
<s> the chance might be slipping away she couldn't tell the chance of keeping her in the family and yet she dared not speak <\s>
<s> her eyes followed june to the door <\s>
<s> then with an exclamation mrs <\s>
<s> baynes ran forward wobbling her bulky frame from side to side and opened it again <\s>
<s> she heard the front door click and stood still an expression of real anger and mortification on her face <\s>
<s> june went along the square with her bird like quickness <\s>
<s> she detested that woman now whom in happier days she had been accustomed to think so kind <\s>
<s> was she always to be put off thus and forced to undergo this torturing suspense <\s>
<s> she would go to phil himself and ask him what he meant <\s>
<s> she had the right to know <\s>
<s> she hurried on down sloane street till she came to bosinney's number <\s>
<s> passing the swing door at the bottom she ran up the stairs her heart thumping painfully <\s>
<s> at the top of the third flight she paused for breath and holding on to the bannisters stood listening <\s>
<s> no sound came from above <\s>
<s> with a very white face she mounted the last flight <\s>
<s> she saw the door with his name on the plate <\s>
<s> and the resolution that had brought her so far evaporated <\s>
<s> the full meaning of her conduct came to her <\s>
<s> she felt hot all over the palms of her hands were moist beneath the thin silk covering of her gloves <\s>
<s> she drew back to the stairs but did not descend <\s>
<s> leaning against the rail she tried to get rid of a feeling of being choked and she gazed at the door with a sort of dreadful courage <\s>
<s> she refused to go down <\s>
<s> did it matter what people thought of her <\s>
<s> they would never know <\s>
<s> no one would help her if she did not help herself <\s>
