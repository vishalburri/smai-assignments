<s> irene was in what was called the ladies drawing room of the piedmont hotel <\s>
<s> nothing if not morally courageous june walked straight up to her former friend kissed her cheek and the two settled down on a sofa never sat on since the hotel's foundation <\s>
<s> jolyon could see that irene was deeply affected by this simple forgiveness <\s>
<s> so soames has been worrying you <\s>
<s> i had a visit from him last night he wants me to go back to him <\s>
<s> you're not going of course <\s>
<s> irene smiled faintly and shook her head <\s>
<s> but his position is horrible she murmured <\s>
<s> it's his own fault he ought to have divorced you when he could <\s>
<s> jolyon remembered how fervently in the old days june had hoped that no divorce would smirch her dead and faithless lover's name <\s>
<s> let us hear what irene is going to do he said <\s>
<s> irene's lips quivered but she spoke calmly <\s>
<s> i'd better give him fresh excuse to get rid of me <\s>
<s> what else can i do <\s>
<s> out of the question said jolyon very quietly sans amour <\s>

<s> june said suddenly well i shall go to soames and tell him he must leave you alone <\s>
<s> what does he want at his age <\s>
<s> it's not unnatural a child <\s>
<s> to leave his money to <\s>
<s> if he wants one badly enough let him take somebody and have one then you can divorce him and he can marry her <\s>
<s> jolyon perceived suddenly that he had made a mistake to bring june her violent partizanship was fighting soames battle <\s>

<s> of course said june only .... <\s>
<s> irene looked full at jolyon in all his many attempts afterwards to analyze that glance he never could succeed <\s>
<s> i should only bring trouble on you all <\s>
<s> i will go abroad <\s>
<s> he knew from her voice that this was final <\s>
<s> the irrelevant thought flashed through him well i could see her there <\s>

<s> i can but try <\s>
<s> june sprang up and paced the room <\s>
<s> it's all horrible she said <\s>

<s> i haven't seen her since <\s>
<s> i'd love to help her <\s>
<s> it was jolyon's turn to squeeze her arm in warm admiration for this spirited generous hearted little creature of his begetting <\s>
<s> irene is proud he said with a sidelong glance in sudden doubt of june's discretion she's difficult to help <\s>
<s> we must tread gently <\s>
<s> this is the place <\s>
<s> i wired her to expect us <\s>
<s> let's send up our cards <\s>
<s> i can't bear soames said june as she got out he sneers at everything that isn't successful <\s>
<s> irene was in what was called the ladies drawing room of the piedmont hotel <\s>
<s> nothing if not morally courageous june walked straight up to her former friend kissed her cheek and the two settled down on a sofa never sat on since the hotel's foundation <\s>
<s> jolyon could see that irene was deeply affected by this simple forgiveness <\s>
<s> so soames has been worrying you <\s>
<s> i had a visit from him last night he wants me to go back to him <\s>
<s> you're not going of course <\s>
<s> irene smiled faintly and shook her head <\s>
<s> but his position is horrible she murmured <\s>
<s> it's his own fault he ought to have divorced you when he could <\s>
<s> jolyon remembered how fervently in the old days june had hoped that no divorce would smirch her dead and faithless lover's name <\s>
<s> let us hear what irene is going to do he said <\s>
<s> irene's lips quivered but she spoke calmly <\s>
<s> i'd better give him fresh excuse to get rid of me <\s>
<s> what else can i do <\s>
<s> out of the question said jolyon very quietly sans amour <\s>
<s> he thought she was going to cry but getting up quickly she half turned her back on them and stood regaining control of herself <\s>
<s> june said suddenly well i shall go to soames and tell him he must leave you alone <\s>
<s> what does he want at his age <\s>
<s> it's not unnatural a child <\s>
<s> to leave his money to <\s>
<s> if he wants one badly enough let him take somebody and have one then you can divorce him and he can marry her <\s>
<s> jolyon perceived suddenly that he had made a mistake to bring june her violent partizanship was fighting soames battle <\s>
<s> it would be best for irene to come quietly to us at robin hill and see how things shape <\s>
<s> of course said june only .... <\s>
<s> irene looked full at jolyon in all his many attempts afterwards to analyze that glance he never could succeed <\s>
<s> i should only bring trouble on you all <\s>
<s> i will go abroad <\s>
<s> he knew from her voice that this was final <\s>
<s> the irrelevant thought flashed through him well i could see her there <\s>
<s> but he said don't you think you would be more helpless abroad in case he followed <\s>
<s> i can but try <\s>
<s> june sprang up and paced the room <\s>
<s> it's all horrible she said <\s>
<s> why should people be tortured and kept miserable and helpless year after year by this disgusting sanctimonious law <\s>
<s> but someone had come into the room and june came to a standstill <\s>
<s> jolyon went up to irene do you want money <\s>
<s> and would you like me to let your flat <\s>
<s> when shall you be going <\s>
<s> you won't go back there in the meantime will you <\s>
<s> this he said with an anxiety strange to himself <\s>
<s> no i've got all i want here <\s>
<s> you'll send me your address <\s>
<s> she put out her hand to him <\s>
<s> i feel you're a rock <\s>
<s> built on sand answered jolyon pressing her hand hard but it's a pleasure to do anything at any time remember that <\s>
<s> and if you change your mind ... <\s>
<s> come along june say good bye <\s>
<s> june came from the window and flung her arms round irene <\s>
<s> don't think of him she said under her breath enjoy yourself and bless you <\s>
<s> with a memory of tears in irene's eyes and of a smile on her lips they went away extremely silent passing the lady who had interrupted the interview and was turning over the papers on the table <\s>
<s> opposite the national gallery june exclaimed of all undignified beasts and horrible laws <\s>
<s> but jolyon did not respond <\s>
<s> he had something of his father's balance and could see things impartially even when his emotions were roused <\s>
<s> irene was right soames position was as bad or worse than her own <\s>
<s> as for the law it catered for a human nature of which it took a naturally low view <\s>
<s> and feeling that if he stayed in his daughter's company he would in one way or another commit an indiscretion he told her he must catch his train back to oxford and hailing a cab left her to turner's water colours with the promise that he would think over that gallery <\s>
<s> but he thought over irene instead <\s>
<s> pity they said was akin to love <\s>
<s> if so he was certainly in danger of loving her for he pitied her profoundly <\s>
<s> to think of her drifting about europe so handicapped and lonely <\s>
<s> i hope to goodness she'll keep her head <\s>
<s> he thought she might easily grow desperate <\s>
<s> in fact now that she had cut loose from her poor threads of occupation he couldn't imagine how she would go on so beautiful a creature hopeless and fair game for anyone <\s>
