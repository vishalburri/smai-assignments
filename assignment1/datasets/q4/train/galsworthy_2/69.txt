<s> and you thought that would bring him <\s>
<s> i don't know my lord i acted on my father's advice <\s>
<s> something in the judge's face in the sound of the papers behind him in the sudden crossing of his uncle's legs told val that she had made just the right answer <\s>
<s> he thought by jove what humbug it all is <\s>
<s> the judge was speaking just one more question mrs <\s>
<s> are you still fond of your husband <\s>
<s> val's hands slack behind him became fists <\s>
<s> what business had that judge to make things human suddenly <\s>
<s> to make his mother speak out of her heart and say what perhaps she didn't know herself before all these people <\s>
<s> his mother answered rather low yes my lord <\s>
<s> val saw the judge nod <\s>
<s> wish i could take a cock shy at your head <\s>
<s> he thought irreverently as his mother came back to her seat beside him <\s>
<s> witnesses to his father's departure and continued absence followed one of their own maids even which struck val as particularly beastly there was more talking all humbug and then the judge pronounced the decree for restitution and they got up to go <\s>
<s> val walked out behind his mother chin squared eyelids drooped doing his level best to despise everybody <\s>
<s> his mother's voice in the corridor roused him from an angry trance <\s>
<s> you behaved beautifully dear <\s>
<s> it was such a comfort to have you <\s>
<s> your uncle and i are going to lunch <\s>
<s> all right said val i shall have time to go and see that fellow <\s>
<s> and parting from them abruptly he ran down the stairs and out into the air <\s>
<s> he bolted into a hansom and drove to the goat's club <\s>
<s> his thoughts were on holly and what he must do before her brother showed her this thing in to morrow's paper <\s>
<s> when val had left them soames and winifred made their way to the cheshire cheese <\s>
<s> he had suggested it as a meeting place with mr <\s>
<s> at that early hour of noon they would have it to themselves and winifred had thought it would be amusing to see this far famed hostelry <\s>
<s> having ordered a light repast to the consternation of the waiter they awaited its arrival together with that of mr <\s>
<s> bellby in silent reaction after the hour and a half's suspense on the tenterhooks of publicity <\s>
<s> bellby entered presently preceded by his nose as cheerful as they were glum <\s>
<s> they had got the decree of restitution and what was the matter with that <\s>
<s> quite said soames in a suitably low voice but we shall have to begin again to get evidence <\s>
<s> he'll probably try the divorce it will look fishy if it comes out that we knew of misconduct from the start <\s>
<s> his questions showed well enough that he doesn't like this restitution dodge <\s>
<s> bellby cheerily he'll forget <\s>
<s> why man he'll have tried a hundred cases between now and then <\s>
<s> besides he's bound by precedent to give ye your divorce if the evidence is satisfactory <\s>
<s> we won't let um know that mrs <\s>
<s> dartie had knowledge of the facts <\s>
<s> dreamer did it very nicely he's got a fatherly touch about um <\s>
