<s> perhaps said soames but don't speak of it <\s>
<s> i just want your opinion <\s>
<s> quite so said the architect <\s>

<s> you're rather high up here he remarked <\s>

<s> soames noted a hollow in each cheek made as it were by suction <\s>
<s> what do you pay for an office like this <\s>
<s> fifty too much replied bosinney <\s>
<s> this answer impressed soames favourably <\s>
<s> i suppose it is dear he said <\s>
<s> i'll call for you on sunday about eleven <\s>
<s> the following sunday therefore he called for bosinney in a hansom and drove him to the station <\s>
<s> on arriving at robin hill they found no cab and started to walk the mile and a half to the site <\s>
<s> it was the 1st of august a perfect day with a burning sun and cloudless sky and in the straight narrow road leading up the hill their feet kicked up a yellow dust <\s>
<s> this was not unusual <\s>
<s> it happened in fact every day <\s>
<s> he could not understand what she found wrong with him <\s>
<s> it was not as if he drank <\s>
<s> did he run into debt or gamble or swear was he violent were his friends rackety did he stay out at night <\s>
<s> the profound subdued aversion which he felt in his wife was a mystery to him and a source of the most terrible irritation <\s>
<s> that she had made a mistake and did not love him had tried to love him and could not love him was obviously no reason <\s>
<s> he that could imagine so outlandish a cause for his wife's not getting on with him was certainly no forsyte <\s>
<s> soames was forced therefore to set the blame entirely down to his wife <\s>
<s> he had never met a woman so capable of inspiring affection <\s>
<s> they could not go anywhere without his seeing how all the men were attracted by her their looks manners voices betrayed it her behaviour under this attention had been beyond reproach <\s>
<s> that she was one of those women not too common in the anglo saxon race born to be loved and to love who when not loving are not living had certainly never even occurred to him <\s>
<s> her power of attraction he regarded as part of her value as his property but it made him indeed suspect that she could give as well as receive and she gave him nothing <\s>
<s> then why did she marry me <\s>
<s> was his continual thought <\s>
<s> he had forgotten his courtship that year and a half when he had besieged and lain in wait for her devising schemes for her entertainment giving her presents proposing to her periodically and keeping her other admirers away with his perpetual presence <\s>
<s> he had forgotten the day when adroitly taking advantage of an acute phase of her dislike to her home surroundings he crowned his labours with success <\s>
<s> if he remembered anything it was the dainty capriciousness with which the gold haired dark eyed girl had treated him <\s>
<s> he certainly did not remember the look on her face strange passive appealing when suddenly one day she had yielded and said that she would marry him <\s>
