<s> as for himself he had given a motor ambulance read the papers till he was sick of them passed through much anxiety bought no clothes lost seven pounds in weight he didn't know what more he could have done at his age <\s>
<s> indeed thinking it over it struck him that he and his family had taken this war very differently to that affair with the boers which had been supposed to tax all the resources of the empire <\s>
<s> in that old war of course his nephew val dartie had been wounded that fellow jolyon's first son had died of enteric the dromios had gone out on horses and june had been a nurse but all that had seemed in the nature of a portent while in this war everybody had done their bit so far as he could make out as a matter of course <\s>
<s> it seemed to show the growth of something or other or perhaps the decline of something else <\s>
<s> had the forsytes become less individual or more imperial or less provincial <\s>
<s> or was it simply that one hated germans ... <\s>
<s> why didn't fleur come so that he could get away <\s>
<s> he saw those three return together from the other room and pass back along the far side of the screen <\s>
<s> the boy was standing before the juno now <\s>
<s> and suddenly on the other side of her soames saw his daughter with eyebrows raised as well they might be <\s>
<s> he could see her eyes glint sideways at the boy and the boy look back at her <\s>
<s> then irene slipped her hand through his arm and drew him on <\s>
<s> soames saw him glancing round and fleur looking after them as the three went out <\s>
<s> a voice said cheerfully bit thick isn't it sir <\s>
<s> the young man who had handed him his handkerchief was again passing <\s>
<s> i don't know what we're coming to <\s>
<s> that's all right sir answered the young man cheerfully they don't either <\s>
<s> fleur's voice said hallo father <\s>
<s> precisely as if he had been keeping her waiting <\s>
<s> the young man snatching off his hat passed on <\s>
<s> well said soames looking her up and down you're a punctual sort of young woman <\s>
<s> this treasured possession of his life was of medium height and colour with short dark chestnut hair her wide apart brown eyes were set in whites so clear that they glinted when they moved and yet in repose were almost dreamy under very white black lashed lids held over them in a sort of suspense <\s>
<s> she had a charming profile and nothing of her father in her face save a decided chin <\s>
<s> aware that his expression was softening as he looked at her soames frowned to preserve the unemotionalism proper to a forsyte <\s>
<s> he knew she was only too inclined to take advantage of his weakness <\s>
<s> slipping her hand under his arm she said who was that <\s>
<s> he picked up my handkerchief <\s>
<s> we talked about the pictures <\s>
<s> you're not going to buy that father <\s>
<s> no said soames grimly nor that juno you've been looking at <\s>
<s> fleur dragged at his arm <\s>
<s> it's a ghastly show <\s>
<s> in the doorway they passed the young man called mont and his partner <\s>
<s> but soames had hung out a board marked trespassers will be prosecuted and he barely acknowledged the young fellow's salute <\s>
<s> well he said in the street whom did you meet at imogen's <\s>
<s> aunt winifred and that monsieur profond <\s>
<s> muttered soames that chap <\s>
<s> what does your aunt see in him <\s>
<s> he looks pretty deep mother says she likes him <\s>
<s> cousin val and his wife were there too <\s>
<s> i thought they were back in south africa <\s>
<s> they've sold their farm <\s>
<s> cousin val is going to train race horses on the sussex downs <\s>
<s> they've got a jolly old manor house they asked me down there <\s>
<s> soames coughed the news was distasteful to him <\s>
<s> what's his wife like now <\s>
<s> very quiet but nice i think <\s>
<s> he's a rackety chap your cousin val <\s>
<s> no father they're awfully devoted <\s>
<s> i promised to go saturday to wednesday next <\s>
<s> it was extravagant but not the reason for his distaste <\s>
