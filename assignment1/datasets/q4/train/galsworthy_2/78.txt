<s> the storm had passed over the poultry at four o'clock bringing welcome distraction to the clerks in every office <\s>
<s> soames was drinking a cup of tea when a note was brought in to him dear sir forsyte v <\s>
<s> forsyte and forsyte in accordance with your instructions we beg to inform you that we personally served the respondent and co respondent in this suit to day at richmond and robin hill respectively <\s>
<s> faithfully yours linkman and laver <\s>
<s> for some minutes soames stared at that note <\s>
<s> ever since he had given those instructions he had been tempted to annul them <\s>
<s> it was so scandalous such a general disgrace <\s>
<s> the evidence too what he had heard of it had never seemed to him conclusive somehow he believed less and less that those two had gone all lengths <\s>
<s> but this of course would drive them to it and he suffered from the thought <\s>
<s> that fellow to have her love where he had failed <\s>
<s> was it too late <\s>
<s> now that they had been brought up sharp by service of this petition had he not a lever with which he could force them apart <\s>
<s> but if i don't act at once he thought it will be too late now they've had this thing <\s>
<s> i'll go and see him i'll go down <\s>
<s> and sick with nervous anxiety he sent out for one of the new fangled motor cabs <\s>
<s> it might take a long time to run that fellow to ground and goodness knew what decision they might come to after such a shock <\s>
<s> if i were a theatrical ass he thought i suppose i should be taking a horse whip or a pistol or something <\s>
<s> he took instead a bundle of papers in the case of magentie versus wake intending to read them on the way down <\s>
<s> he did not even open them but sat quite still jolted and jarred unconscious of the draught down the back of his neck or the smell of petrol <\s>
<s> he must be guided by the fellow's attitude the great thing was to keep his head <\s>
<s> london had already begun to disgorge its workers as he neared putney bridge the ant heap was on the move outwards <\s>
<s> what a lot of ants all with a living to get holding on by their eyelids in the great scramble <\s>
