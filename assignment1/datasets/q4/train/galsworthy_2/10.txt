<s> soames went to the drawing room presently and peered at her through the window <\s>
<s> out in the shadow of the japanese sunshade she was sitting very still the lace on her white shoulders stirring with the soft rise and fall of her bosom <\s>

<s> it was enough to make a man get up and leave the table <\s>
<s> the light from the rose shaded lamp fell on her neck and arms soames liked her to dine in a low dress it gave him an inexpressible feeling of superiority to the majority of his acquaintance whose wives were contented with their best high frocks or with tea gowns when they dined at home <\s>

<s> soames went to the drawing room presently and peered at her through the window <\s>
<s> out in the shadow of the japanese sunshade she was sitting very still the lace on her white shoulders stirring with the soft rise and fall of her bosom <\s>

<s> it was enough to make a man get up and leave the table <\s>
<s> the light from the rose shaded lamp fell on her neck and arms soames liked her to dine in a low dress it gave him an inexpressible feeling of superiority to the majority of his acquaintance whose wives were contented with their best high frocks or with tea gowns when they dined at home <\s>
