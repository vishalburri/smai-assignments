<s> the weather had changed was mild again as though having finished its work and sent a forsyte to his last account it could relax <\s>
<s> a second telegram received at dinner time had confirmed the good news of annette and instead of going in soames passed down through the garden in the moonlight to his houseboat <\s>
<s> he could sleep there quite well <\s>
<s> bitterly tired he lay down on the sofa in his fur coat and fell asleep <\s>
<s> he woke soon after dawn and went on deck <\s>
<s> he stood against the rail looking west where the river swept round in a wide curve under the woods <\s>
<s> in soames appreciation of natural beauty was curiously like that of his farmer ancestors a sense of grievance if it wasn't there sharpened no doubt and civilised by his researches among landscape painting <\s>
<s> but dawn has power to fertilise the most matter of fact vision and he was stirred <\s>
<s> it was another world from the river he knew under that remote cool light a world into which man had not entered an unreal world like some strange shore sighted by discovery <\s>
<s> its colour was not the colour of convention was hardly colour at all its shapes were brooding yet distinct its silence stunning it had no scent <\s>
<s> why it should move him he could not tell unless it were that he felt so alone in it bare of all relationship and all possessions <\s>
<s> into such a world his father might be voyaging for all resemblance it had to the world he had left <\s>
<s> and soames took refuge from it in wondering what painter could have done it justice <\s>
<s> the white grey water was like like the belly of a fish <\s>
<s> was it possible that this world on which he looked was all private property except the water and even that was tapped <\s>
<s> no tree no shrub not a blade of grass not a bird or beast not even a fish that was not owned <\s>
<s> and once on a time all this was jungle and marsh and water and weird creatures roamed and sported without human cognizance to give them names rotting luxuriance had rioted where those tall carefully planted woods came down to the water and marsh misted reeds on that far side had covered all the pasture <\s>
<s> they had got it under kennelled it all up labelled it and stowed it in lawyers offices <\s>
<s> and a good thing too <\s>
<s> but once in a way as now the ghost of the past came out to haunt and brood and whisper to any human who chanced to be awake out of my unowned loneliness you all came into it some day you will all return <\s>
<s> and soames who felt the chill and the eeriness of that world new to him and so very old the world unowned visiting the scene of its past went down and made himself tea on a spirit lamp <\s>
<s> when he had drunk it he took out writing materials and wrote two paragraphs on the 20th instant at his residence in park lane james forsyte in his ninety first year <\s>
<s> funeral at noon on the 24th at highgate <\s>
<s> no flowers by request <\s>
<s> on the 20th instant at the shelter mapledurham annette wife of soames forsyte of a daughter <\s>
<s> and underneath on the blottingpaper he traced the word son <\s>
<s> it was eight o'clock in an ordinary autumn world when he went across to the house <\s>
<s> bushes across the river stood round and bright coloured out of a milky haze the wood smoke went up blue and straight and his doves cooed preening their feathers in the sunlight <\s>
<s> he stole up to his dressing room bathed shaved put on fresh linen and dark clothes <\s>
<s> madame lamotte was beginning her breakfast when he went down <\s>
<s> she looked at his clothes said don't tell me <\s>
<s> and pressed his hand <\s>
<s> annette is prettee well <\s>
<s> but the doctor say she can never have no more children <\s>
<s> mais la petite est adorable <\s>
<s> soames got away from her as soon as he could <\s>
<s> she offended him solid matter of fact quick clear french <\s>
<s> he could not bear her vowels her r's he resented the way she had looked at him as if it were his fault that annette could never bear him a son <\s>
<s> he even resented her cheap adoration of the daughter he had not yet seen <\s>
<s> curious how he jibbed away from sight of his wife and child <\s>
<s> one would have thought he must have rushed up at the first moment <\s>
<s> on the contrary he had a sort of physical shrinking from it fastidious possessor that he was <\s>
<s> he was afraid of what annette was thinking of him author of her agonies afraid of the look of the baby afraid of showing his disappointment with the present and the future <\s>
<s> he spent an hour walking up and down the drawing room before he could screw his courage up to mount the stairs and knock on the door of their room <\s>
<s> madame lamotte opened it <\s>
<s> at last you come <\s>
<s> she passed him and soames went in with his noiseless step his jaw firmly set his eyes furtive <\s>
<s> annette was very pale and very pretty lying there <\s>
<s> the baby was hidden away somewhere he could not see it <\s>
<s> he went up to the bed and with sudden emotion bent and kissed her forehead <\s>
<s> here you are then soames she said <\s>
<s> i am not so bad now <\s>
<s> but i suffered terribly terribly <\s>
<s> i am glad i cannot have any more <\s>
<s> soames stood silent stroking her hand words of endearment of sympathy absolutely would not come the thought passed through him an english girl wouldn't have said that <\s>
<s> at this moment he knew with certainty that he would never be near to her in spirit and in truth nor she to him <\s>
<s> he had collected her that was all <\s>
<s> and jolyon's words came rushing into his mind i should imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of chancery <\s>
<s> well he had got it out <\s>
<s> had he got it in again <\s>
<s> we must feed you up he said you'll soon be strong <\s>
<s> don't you want to see baby soames <\s>
<s> of course said soames very much <\s>
<s> he passed round the foot of the bed to the other side and stood staring <\s>
<s> for the first moment what he saw was much what he had expected to see a baby <\s>
<s> but as he stared and the baby breathed and made little sleeping movements with its tiny features it seemed to assume an individual shape grew to be like a picture a thing he would know again not repulsive strangely bud like and touching <\s>
<s> it had dark hair <\s>
<s> he touched it with his finger he wanted to see its eyes <\s>
<s> they opened they were dark whether blue or brown he could not tell <\s>
<s> the eyes winked stared they had a sort of sleepy depth in them <\s>
<s> and suddenly his heart felt queer warm as if elated <\s>
<s> fleur repeated soames fleur <\s>
<s> we'll call her that <\s>
<s> the sense of triumph and renewed possession swelled within him <\s>
<s> this this thing was his <\s>

<s> the forsyte saga volume iii <\s>
<s> awakening and to let by john galsworthy awakening to charles scribner awakening through the massive skylight illuminating the hall at robin hill the july sunlight at five o'clock fell just where the broad stairway turned and in that radiant streak little jon forsyte stood blue linen suited <\s>
<s> his hair was shining and his eyes from beneath a frown for he was considering how to go downstairs this last of innumerable times before the car brought his father and mother home <\s>
<s> four at a time and five at the bottom <\s>
<s> but in which fashion <\s>
<s> on his face feet foremost <\s>
<s> on his stomach sideways <\s>
<s> on his back with his arms stretched down on both sides <\s>
<s> or on his face head foremost in a manner unknown as yet to any but himself <\s>
<s> such was the cause of the frown on the illuminated face of little jon .... <\s>
<s> in that summer of 1909 the simple souls who even then desired to simplify the english tongue had of course no cognizance of little jon or they would have claimed him for a disciple <\s>
<s> but one can be too simple in this life for his real name was jolyon and his living father and dead half brother had usurped of old the other shortenings jo and jolly <\s>
<s> as a fact little jon had done his best to conform to convention and spell himself first jhon then john not till his father had explained the sheer necessity had he spelled his name jon <\s>
<s> up till now that father had possessed what was left of his heart by the groom bob who played the concertina and his nurse da who wore the violet dress on sundays and enjoyed the name of spraggins in that private life lived at odd moments even by domestic servants <\s>
<s> his mother had only appeared to him as it were in dreams smelling delicious smoothing his forehead just before he fell asleep and sometimes docking his hair of a golden brown colour <\s>
<s> when he cut his head open against the nursery fender she was there to be bled over and when he had nightmare she would sit on his bed and cuddle his head against her neck <\s>
<s> she was precious but remote because da was so near and there is hardly room for more than one woman at a time in a man's heart <\s>
<s> with his father too of course he had special bonds of union for little jon also meant to be a painter when he grew up with the one small difference that his father painted pictures and little jon intended to paint ceilings and walls standing on a board between two step ladders in a dirty white apron and a lovely smell of whitewash <\s>
<s> his father also took him riding in richmond park on his pony mouse so called because it was so coloured <\s>
<s> little jon had been born with a silver spoon in a mouth which was rather curly and large <\s>
<s> he had never heard his father or his mother speak in an angry voice either to each other himself or anybody else the groom bob cook jane bella and the other servants even da who alone restrained him in his courses had special voices when they talked to him <\s>
<s> he was therefore of opinion that the world was a place of perfect and perpetual gentility and freedom <\s>
<s> a child of 1901 he had come to consciousness when his country just over that bad attack of scarlet fever the boer war was preparing for the liberal revival of 1906 <\s>
<s> coercion was unpopular parents had exalted notions of giving their offspring a good time <\s>
