<s> forsyte saga complete by john galsworthy ed <\s>
<s> note the spelling conforms to the original s's instead of our z's and c's where we would have s's and ... our in colour and flavour many interesting double consonants etc contents part 1 <\s>
<s> the man of property part 2 <\s>
<s> indian summer of a forsyte in chancery part 3 <\s>
<s> awakening to let the man of property to my wife i dedicate the forsyte saga in its entirety believing it to be of all my works the least unworthy of one without whose encouragement sympathy and criticism i could never have become even such a writer as i am <\s>
<s> preface the forsyte saga was the title originally destined for that part of it which is called the man of property and to adopt it for the collected chronicles of the forsyte family has indulged the forsytean tenacity that is in all of us <\s>
<s> the word saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages <\s>
<s> but it is used with a suitable irony and after all this long tale though it may deal with folk in frock coats furbelows and a gilt edged period is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict <\s>
<s> discounting for the gigantic stature and blood thirstiness of old days as they have come down to us in fairy tale and legend the folk of the old sagas were forsytes assuredly in their possessive instincts and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as swithin soames or even young jolyon <\s>
<s> and if heroic figures in days that never were seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a forsyte of the victorian era we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day for all the recent efforts to talk them out <\s>
<s> so many people have written and claimed that their families were the originals of the forsytes that one has been almost encouraged to believe in the typicality of an imagined species <\s>
<s> manners change and modes evolve and timothy's on the bayswater road becomes a nest of the unbelievable in all except essentials we shall not look upon its like again nor perhaps on such a one as james or old jolyon <\s>
<s> and yet the figures of insurance societies and the utterances of judges reassure us daily that our earthly paradise is still a rich preserve where the wild raiders beauty and passion come stealing in filching security from beneath our noses <\s>
<s> as surely as a dog will bark at a brass band so will the essential soames in human nature ever rise up uneasily against the dissolution which hovers round the folds of ownership <\s>
<s> let the dead past bury its dead would be a better saying if the past ever died <\s>
<s> the persistence of the past is one of those tragi comic blessings which each new age denies coming cocksure on to the stage to mouth its claim to a perfect novelty <\s>
<s> but no age is so new as that <\s>
<s> human nature under its changing pretensions and clothes is and ever will be very much of a forsyte and might after all be a much worse animal <\s>
<s> looking back on the victorian era whose ripeness decline and fall of is in some sort pictured in the forsyte saga we see now that we have but jumped out of a frying pan into a fire <\s>
<s> it would be difficult to substantiate a claim that the case of england was better in 1913 than it was in 1886 when the forsytes assembled at old jolyon's to celebrate the engagement of june to philip bosinney <\s>
<s> and in 1920 when again the clan gathered to bless the marriage of fleur with michael mont the state of england is as surely too molten and bankrupt as in the eighties it was too congealed and low percented <\s>
<s> if these chronicles had been a really scientific study of transition one would have dwelt probably on such factors as the invention of bicycle motor car and flying machine the arrival of a cheap press the decline of country life and increase of the towns the birth of the cinema <\s>
<s> men are in fact quite unable to control their own inventions they at best develop adaptability to the new conditions those inventions create <\s>
<s> but this long tale is no scientific study of a period it is rather an intimate incarnation of the disturbance that beauty effects in the lives of men <\s>
<s> the figure of irene never as the reader may possibly have observed present except through the senses of other characters is a concretion of disturbing beauty impinging on a possessive world <\s>
<s> one has noticed that readers as they wade on through the salt waters of the saga are inclined more and more to pity soames and to think that in doing so they are in revolt against the mood of his creator <\s>
<s> he too pities soames the tragedy of whose life is the very simple uncontrollable tragedy of being unlovable without quite a thick enough skin to be thoroughly unconscious of the fact <\s>
<s> not even fleur loves soames as he feels he ought to be loved <\s>
<s> but in pitying soames readers incline perhaps to animus against irene after all they think he wasn't a bad fellow it wasn't his fault she ought to have forgiven him and so on <\s>
<s> and taking sides they lose perception of the simple truth which underlies the whole story that where sex attraction is utterly and definitely lacking in one partner to a union no amount of pity or reason or duty or what not can overcome a repulsion implicit in nature <\s>
<s> whether it ought to or no is beside the point because in fact it never does <\s>
<s> and where irene seems hard and cruel as in the bois de boulogne or the goupenor gallery she is but wisely realistic knowing that the least concession is the inch which precedes the impossible the repulsive ell <\s>
<s> a criticism one might pass on the last phase of the saga is the complaint that irene and jolyon those rebels against property claim spiritual property in their son jon <\s>
<s> but it would be hypercriticism as the tale is told <\s>
<s> no father and mother could have let the boy marry fleur without knowledge of the facts and the facts determine jon not the persuasion of his parents <\s>
<s> moreover jolyon's persuasion is not on his own account but on irene's and irene's persuasion becomes a reiterated don't think of me think of yourself <\s>
<s> that jon knowing the facts can realise his mother's feelings will hardly with justice be held proof that she is after all a forsyte <\s>
<s> but though the impingement of beauty and the claims of freedom on a possessive world are the main prepossessions of the forsyte saga it cannot be absolved from the charge of embalming the upper middle class <\s>
<s> as the old egyptians placed around their mummies the necessaries of a future existence so i have endeavoured to lay beside the figures of aunts ann and juley and hester of timothy and swithin of old jolyon and james and of their sons that which shall guarantee them a little life here after a little balm in the hurried gilead of a dissolving progress <\s>
<s> if the upper middle class with other classes is destined to move on into amorphism here pickled in these pages it lies under glass for strollers in the wide and ill arranged museum of letters <\s>
<s> here it rests preserved in its own juice the sense of property <\s>
<s> 1922 the man of property by john galsworthy ........ you will answer the slaves are ours ..... <\s>
<s> to edward garnett part i chapter i 'at home at old jolyon's those privileged to be present at a family festival of the forsytes have seen that charming and instructive sight an upper middle class family in full plumage <\s>
<s> but whosoever of these favoured persons has possessed the gift of psychological analysis a talent without monetary value and properly ignored by the forsytes has witnessed a spectacle not only delightful in itself but illustrative of an obscure human problem <\s>
<s> in plainer words he has gleaned from a gathering of this family no branch of which had a liking for the other between no three members of whom existed anything worthy of the name of sympathy evidence of that mysterious concrete tenacity which renders a family so formidable a unit of society so clear a reproduction of society in miniature <\s>
<s> he has been admitted to a vision of the dim roads of social progress has understood something of patriarchal life of the swarmings of savage hordes of the rise and fall of nations <\s>
<s> he is like one who having watched a tree grow from its planting a paragon of tenacity insulation and success amidst the deaths of a hundred other plants less fibrous sappy and persistent one day will see it flourishing with bland full foliage in an almost repugnant prosperity at the summit of its efflorescence <\s>
<s> on june 15 eighteen eighty six about four of the afternoon the observer who chanced to be present at the house of old jolyon forsyte in stanhope gate might have seen the highest efflorescence of the forsytes <\s>
<s> this was the occasion of an at home to celebrate the engagement of miss june forsyte old jolyon's granddaughter to mr <\s>
<s> in the bravery of light gloves buff waistcoats feathers and frocks the family were present even aunt ann who now but seldom left the corner of her brother timothy's green drawing room where under the aegis of a plume of dyed pampas grass in a light blue vase she sat all day reading and knitting surrounded by the effigies of three generations of forsytes <\s>
<s> even aunt ann was there her inflexible back and the dignity of her calm old face personifying the rigid possessiveness of the family idea <\s>
<s> when a forsyte was engaged married or born the forsytes were present when a forsyte died but no forsyte had as yet died they did not die death being contrary to their principles they took precautions against it the instinctive precautions of highly vitalized persons who resent encroachments on their property <\s>
<s> about the forsytes mingling that day with the crowd of other guests there was a more than ordinarily groomed look an alert inquisitive assurance a brilliant respectability as though they were attired in defiance of something <\s>
<s> the habitual sniff on the face of soames forsyte had spread through their ranks they were on their guard <\s>
<s> the subconscious offensiveness of their attitude has constituted old jolyon's home the psychological moment of the family history made it the prelude of their drama <\s>
<s> the forsytes were resentful of something not individually but as a family this resentment expressed itself in an added perfection of raiment an exuberance of family cordiality an exaggeration of family importance and the sniff <\s>
<s> danger so indispensable in bringing out the fundamental quality of any society group or individual was what the forsytes scented the premonition of danger put a burnish on their armour <\s>
<s> for the first time as a family they appeared to have an instinct of being in contact with some strange and unsafe thing <\s>
<s> over against the piano a man of bulk and stature was wearing two waistcoats on his wide chest two waistcoats and a ruby pin instead of the single satin waistcoat and diamond pin of more usual occasions and his shaven square old face the colour of pale leather with pale eyes had its most dignified look above his satin stock <\s>
<s> this was swithin forsyte <\s>
<s> close to the window where he could get more than his fair share of fresh air the other twin james the fat and the lean of it old jolyon called these brothers like the bulky swithin over six feet in height but very lean as though destined from his birth to strike a balance and maintain an average brooded over the scene with his permanent stoop his grey eyes had an air of fixed absorption in some secret worry broken at intervals by a rapid shifting scrutiny of surrounding facts his cheeks thinned by two parallel folds and a long clean shaven upper lip were framed within dundreary whiskers <\s>
<s> in his hands he turned and turned a piece of china <\s>
<s> not far off listening to a lady in brown his only son soames pale and well shaved dark haired rather bald had poked his chin up sideways carrying his nose with that aforesaid appearance of sniff as though despising an egg which he knew he could not digest <\s>
<s> behind him his cousin the tall george son of the fifth forsyte roger had a quilpish look on his fleshy face pondering one of his sardonic jests <\s>
<s> something inherent to the occasion had affected them all <\s>
<s> seated in a row close to one another were three ladies aunts ann hester the two forsyte maids and juley short for julia who not in first youth had so far forgotten herself as to marry septimus small a man of poor constitution <\s>
<s> she had survived him for many years <\s>
<s> with her elder and younger sister she lived now in the house of timothy her sixth and youngest brother on the bayswater road <\s>
<s> each of these ladies held fans in their hands and each with some touch of colour some emphatic feather or brooch testified to the solemnity of the opportunity <\s>
<s> in the centre of the room under the chandelier as became a host stood the head of the family old jolyon himself <\s>
<s> eighty years of age with his fine white hair his dome like forehead his little dark grey eyes and an immense white moustache which drooped and spread below the level of his strong jaw he had a patriarchal look and in spite of lean cheeks and hollows at his temples seemed master of perennial youth <\s>
<s> he held himself extremely upright and his shrewd steady eyes had lost none of their clear shining <\s>
<s> thus he gave an impression of superiority to the doubts and dislikes of smaller men <\s>
<s> having had his own way for innumerable years he had earned a prescriptive right to it <\s>
<s> it would never have occurred to old jolyon that it was necessary to wear a look of doubt or of defiance <\s>
<s> between him and the four other brothers who were present james swithin nicholas and roger there was much difference much similarity <\s>
<s> in turn each of these four brothers was very different from the other yet they too were alike <\s>
<s> through the varying features and expression of those five faces could be marked a certain steadfastness of chin underlying surface distinctions marking a racial stamp too prehistoric to trace too remote and permanent to discuss the very hall mark and guarantee of the family fortunes <\s>
<s> among the younger generation in the tall bull like george in pallid strenuous archibald in young nicholas with his sweet and tentative obstinacy in the grave and foppishly determined eustace there was this same stamp less meaningful perhaps but unmistakable a sign of something ineradicable in the family soul <\s>
<s> at one time or another during the afternoon all these faces so dissimilar and so alike had worn an expression of distrust the object of which was undoubtedly the man whose acquaintance they were thus assembled to make <\s>
<s> philip bosinney was known to be a young man without fortune but forsyte girls had become engaged to such before and had actually married them <\s>
<s> it was not altogether for this reason therefore that the minds of the forsytes misgave them <\s>
<s> they could not have explained the origin of a misgiving obscured by the mist of family gossip <\s>
<s> a story was undoubtedly told that he had paid his duty call to aunts ann juley and hester in a soft grey hat a soft grey hat not even a new one a dusty thing with a shapeless crown <\s>
