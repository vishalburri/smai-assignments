<s> jon flung himself down and reaching over the arm of the chair where he had lately been sitting put his lips to the forehead <\s>
<s> how could how could dad be dead when only an hour ago <\s>
<s> his mother's arms were round the knees pressing her breast against them <\s>
<s> why why wasn't i with him <\s>
<s> he heard her whisper <\s>
<s> then he saw the tottering word irene pencilled on the open page and broke down himself <\s>
<s> it was his first sight of human death and its unutterable stillness blotted from him all other emotion all else then was but preliminary to this <\s>
<s> all love and life and joy anxiety and sorrow all movement light and beauty but a beginning to this terrible white stillness <\s>
<s> it made a dreadful mark on him all seemed suddenly little futile short <\s>
<s> he mastered himself at last got up and raised her <\s>
<s> some hours later when all was done that had to be and his mother was lying down he saw his father alone on the bed covered with a white sheet <\s>

<s> his own trouble seemed small while he was looking at that face <\s>

<s> now his mother had no one but himself <\s>

<s> it had struck him because he had never heard any one else suggest it <\s>
<s> when the heart failed like this surely it was not quite natural <\s>

<s> he took up the letter again and read on mechanically <\s>
<s> and again came the feeling that it was all dead and disgusting his own love so different <\s>
<s> this letter said his mother and her father <\s>
<s> could there be men who looked on women as their property <\s>
<s> faces seen in street and countryside came thronging up before him red stock fish faces hard dull faces prim dry faces violent faces hundreds thousands of them <\s>
<s> how could he know what men who had such faces thought and did <\s>
<s> he held his head in his hands and groaned <\s>
<s> he caught up the letter and read on again horror and aversion alive in her to day .... <\s>
<s> of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave .... <\s>
<s> he got up from his bed <\s>
<s> this cruel shadowy past lurking there to murder his love and fleur's was true or his father could never have written it <\s>
<s> why didn't they tell me the first thing he thought the day i first saw fleur <\s>
<s> they knew i'd seen her <\s>
<s> they were afraid and now i've got it <\s>
<s> overcome by misery too acute for thought or reason he crept into a dusky corner of the room and sat down on the floor <\s>
<s> he sat there like some unhappy little animal <\s>
<s> there was comfort in dusk and the floor as if he were back in those days when he played his battles sprawling all over it <\s>
<s> he sat there huddled his hair ruffled his hands clasped round his knees for how long he did not know <\s>
<s> he was wrenched from his blank wretchedness by the sound of the door opening from his mother's room <\s>
<s> the blinds were down over the windows of his room shut up in his absence and from where he sat he could only hear a rustle her footsteps crossing till beyond the bed he saw her standing before his dressing table <\s>
<s> she had something in her hand <\s>
<s> he hardly breathed hoping she would not see him and go away <\s>
<s> he saw her touch things on the table as if they had some virtue in them then face the window grey from head to foot like a ghost <\s>
<s> the least turn of her head and she must see him <\s>
<s> her lips moved oh <\s>
<s> she was speaking to herself the tone of her voice troubled jon's heart <\s>
<s> he saw in her hand a little photograph <\s>
<s> she held it toward the light looking at it very small <\s>
<s> he knew it one of himself as a tiny boy which she always kept in her bag <\s>
<s> his heart beat fast <\s>
<s> and suddenly as if she had heard it she turned her eyes and saw him <\s>
<s> at the gasp she gave and the movement of her hands pressing the photograph against her breast he said yes it's me <\s>
<s> she moved over to the bed and sat down on it quite close to him her hands still clasping her breast her feet among the sheets of the letter which had slipped to the floor <\s>
