<s> i shan't be able to give you very much he had said a formula to which june was not unaccustomed <\s>
<s> perhaps this what's his name will provide the cocoa <\s>
<s> he had hardly seen anything of her since it began <\s>
<s> he had no notion of giving her a lot of money to enable a fellow he knew nothing about to live on in idleness <\s>

<s> and motionless old jolyon stared at the wall but for his open eyes he might have been asleep .... <\s>
<s> the idea of supposing that young cub soames could give him advice <\s>
<s> he had always been a cub with his nose in the air <\s>
<s> he would be setting up as a man of property next with a place in the country <\s>
<s> a man of property <\s>
<s> like his father he was always nosing out bargains a cold blooded young beggar <\s>
<s> he rose and going to the cabinet began methodically stocking his cigar case from a bundle fresh in <\s>
<s> they were not bad at the price but you couldn't get a good cigar nowadays nothing to hold a candle to those old superfinos of hanson and bridger's <\s>
<s> that was a cigar <\s>
<s> the thought like some stealing perfume carried him back to those wonderful nights at richmond when after dinner he sat smoking on the terrace of the crown and sceptre with nicholas treffry and traquair and jack herring and anthony thornworthy <\s>
<s> how good his cigars were then <\s>
<s> poor old nick dead and jack herring dead and traquair dead of that wife of his and thornworthy awfully shaky no wonder with his appetite <\s>
<s> of all the company of those days he himself alone seemed left except swithin of course and he so outrageously big there was no doing anything with him <\s>
<s> difficult to believe it was so long ago he felt young still <\s>
<s> of all his thoughts as he stood there counting his cigars this was the most poignant the most bitter <\s>
<s> with his white head and his loneliness he had remained young and green at heart <\s>
<s> and those sunday afternoons on hampstead heath when young jolyon and he went for a stretch along the spaniard's road to highgate to child's hill and back over the heath again to dine at jack straw's castle how delicious his cigars were then <\s>
<s> there was no weather now <\s>
<s> when june was a toddler of five and every other sunday he took her to the zoo away from the society of those two good women her mother and her grandmother and at the top of the bear den baited his umbrella with buns for her favourite bears how sweet his cigars were then <\s>
