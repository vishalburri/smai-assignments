<s> his dignity demanded impassivity during this embassy designed to link their offspring who if she had behaved herself would have been brother and sister <\s>
<s> that wretched tune the wild wild women kept running in his head perversely for tunes did not run there as a rule <\s>
<s> passing the poplars in front of the house he thought how they've grown i had them planted <\s>
<s> a maid answered his ring <\s>
<s> forsyte on a very special matter <\s>
<s> if she realised who he was quite probably she would not see him <\s>
<s> he thought hardening as the tug came <\s>
<s> it's a topsy turvy affair <\s>
<s> the maid came back <\s>
<s> would the gentleman state his business please <\s>
<s> say it concerns mr <\s>
<s> and once more he was alone in that hall with the pool of grey white marble designed by her first lover <\s>
<s> she had been a bad lot had loved two men and not himself <\s>
<s> he must remember that when he came face to face with her once more <\s>
<s> and suddenly he saw her in the opening chink between the long heavy purple curtains swaying as if in hesitation the old perfect poise and line the old startled dark eyed gravity the old calm defensive voice will you come in please <\s>
<s> he passed through that opening <\s>
<s> as in the picture gallery and the confectioner's shop she seemed to him still beautiful <\s>
<s> and this was the first time the very first since he married her seven and thirty years ago that he was speaking to her without the legal right to call her his <\s>
<s> she was not wearing black one of that fellow's radical notions he supposed <\s>
<s> i apologise for coming he said glumly but this business must be settled one way or the other <\s>
<s> won't you sit down <\s>
<s> anger at his false position impatience of ceremony between them mastered him and words came tumbling out it's an infernal mischance i've done my best to discourage it <\s>
<s> i consider my daughter crazy but i've got into the habit of indulging her that's why i'm here <\s>
<s> i suppose you're fond of your son <\s>
<s> it rests with him <\s>
<s> he had a sense of being met and baffled <\s>
<s> always always she had baffled him even in those old first married days <\s>
<s> it's a mad notion he said <\s>
<s> if you had only <\s>
<s> well they might have been he did not finish that sentence brother and sister and all this saved but he saw her shudder as if he had and stung by the sight he crossed over to the window <\s>
<s> out there the trees had not grown they couldn't they were old <\s>
<s> so far as i'm concerned he said you may make your mind easy <\s>
<s> i desire to see neither you nor your son if this marriage comes about <\s>

<s> with all my heart not with my lips <\s>
<s> soames stood biting his finger <\s>
<s> i remember an evening he said suddenly and was silent <\s>
<s> what was there what was there in this woman that would not fit into the four corners of his hate or condemnation <\s>
<s> where is he your son <\s>
<s> up in his father's studio i think <\s>
