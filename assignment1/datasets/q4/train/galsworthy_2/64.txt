<s> the boers aren't sports a bit <\s>
<s> why don't they come out into the open <\s>
<s> they've got everything against them except their way of fighting <\s>
<s> i rather admire them <\s>
<s> they can ride and shoot admitted val but they're a lousy lot <\s>
<s> do you know crum <\s>
<s> he's in that fast set too isn't he <\s>
<s> rather la di da and brummagem <\s>
<s> val said fixedly he's a friend of mine <\s>
<s> and they sat awkwardly staring past each other having pitched on their pet points of snobbery <\s>
<s> for jolly was forming himself unconsciously on a set whose motto was we defy you to bore us <\s>
<s> life isn't half long enough and we're going to talk faster and more crisply do more and know more and dwell less on any subject than you can possibly imagine <\s>
<s> we are the best made of wire and whipcord <\s>
<s> and val was unconsciously forming himself on a set whose motto was we defy you to interest or excite us <\s>
<s> we have had every sensation or if we haven't we pretend we have <\s>
<s> we are so exhausted with living that no hours are too small for us <\s>
<s> we will lose our shirts with equanimity <\s>
<s> we have flown fast and are past everything <\s>
<s> all is cigarette smoke <\s>
<s> competitive spirit bone deep in the english was obliging those two young forsytes to have ideals and at the close of a century ideals are mixed <\s>
<s> the aristocracy had already in the main adopted the jumping jesus principle though here and there one like crum who was an honourable' stood starkly languid for that gambler's nirvana which had been the summum bonum of the old dandies and of the mashers in the eighties <\s>
<s> and round crum were still gathered a forlorn hope of blue bloods with a plutocratic following <\s>
<s> but there was between the cousins another far less obvious antipathy coming from the unseizable family resemblance which each perhaps resented or from some half consciousness of that old feud persisting still between their branches of the clan formed within them by odd words or half hints dropped by their elders <\s>
<s> and jolly tinkling his teaspoon was musing his tie pin and his waistcoat and his drawl and his betting good lord <\s>
<s> and val finishing his bun was thinking he's rather a young beast <\s>
<s> i suppose you'll be meeting your people <\s>
<s> he said getting up <\s>
<s> i wish you'd tell them i should like to show them over b n c not that there's anything much there if they'd care to come <\s>
<s> thanks i'll ask them <\s>
<s> i've got rather a decent scout <\s>
<s> jolly doubted if they would have time <\s>
<s> you'll ask them though <\s>
<s> very good of you said jolly fully meaning that they should not go but instinctively polite he added you'd better come and have dinner with us to morrow <\s>
<s> and they parted a subtle antagonism alive within them <\s>
<s> holly and her father arrived by a midday train <\s>
<s> it was her first visit to the city of spires and dreams and she was very silent looking almost shyly at the brother who was part of this wonderful place <\s>
<s> after lunch she wandered examining his household gods with intense curiosity <\s>
<s> jolly's sitting room was panelled and art represented by a set of bartolozzi prints which had belonged to old jolyon and by college photographs of young men live young men a little heroic and to be compared with her memories of val <\s>
<s> jolyon also scrutinised with care that evidence of his boy's character and tastes <\s>
<s> jolly was anxious that they should see him rowing so they set forth to the river <\s>
<s> holly between her brother and her father felt elated when heads were turned and eyes rested on her <\s>
<s> that they might see him to the best advantage they left him at the barge and crossed the river to the towing path <\s>
<s> slight in build for of all the forsytes only old swithin and george were beefy jolly was rowing two in a trial eight <\s>
<s> he looked very earnest and strenuous <\s>
<s> with pride jolyon thought him the best looking boy of the lot holly as became a sister was more struck by one or two of the others but would not have said so for the world <\s>
<s> the river was bright that afternoon the meadows lush the trees still beautiful with colour <\s>
<s> distinguished peace clung around the old city jolyon promised himself a day's sketching if the weather held <\s>
<s> the eight passed a second time spurting home along the barges jolly's face was very set so as not to show that he was blown <\s>
<s> they returned across the river and waited for him <\s>
<s> said jolly in the christ church meadows i had to ask that chap val dartie to dine with us to night <\s>
<s> he wanted to give you lunch and show you b n c so i thought i'd better then you needn't go <\s>
<s> i don't like him much <\s>
<s> holly's rather sallow face had become suffused with pink <\s>
<s> he seems to me rather showy and bad form <\s>
<s> what are his people like dad <\s>
<s> he's only a second cousin isn't he <\s>
<s> jolyon took refuge in a smile <\s>
<s> ask holly he said she saw his uncle <\s>
<s> i liked val holly answered staring at the ground before her his uncle looked awfully different <\s>
<s> she stole a glance at jolly from under her lashes <\s>
<s> did you ever said jolyon with whimsical intention hear our family history my dears <\s>
<s> it's quite a fairy tale <\s>
<s> the first jolyon forsyte at all events the first we know anything of and that would be your great great grandfather dwelt in the land of dorset on the edge of the sea being by profession an agriculturalist as your great aunt put it and the son of an agriculturist farmers in fact your grandfather used to call them very small beer he looked at jolly to see how his lordliness was standing it and with the other eye noted holly's malicious pleasure in the slight drop of her brother's face <\s>
<s> we may suppose him thick and sturdy standing for england as it was before the industrial era began <\s>
<s> the second jolyon forsyte your great grandfather jolly better known as superior dosset forsyte built houses so the chronicle runs begat ten children and migrated to london town <\s>
<s> it is known that he drank sherry <\s>
<s> we may suppose him representing the england of napoleon's wars and general unrest <\s>
<s> the eldest of his six sons was the third jolyon your grandfather my dears tea merchant and chairman of companies one of the soundest englishmen who ever lived and to me the dearest <\s>
<s> jolyon's voice had lost its irony and his son and daughter gazed at him solemnly he was just and tenacious tender and young at heart <\s>
<s> you remember him and i remember him <\s>
<s> pass to the others <\s>
<s> your great uncle james that's young val's grandfather had a son called soames whereby hangs a tale of no love lost and i don't think i'll tell it you <\s>
<s> james and the other eight children of superior dosset of whom there are still five alive may be said to have represented victorian england with its principles of trade and individualism at five per cent <\s>
<s> and your money back if you know what that means <\s>
<s> at all events they've turned thirty thousand pounds into a cool million between them in the course of their long lives <\s>
<s> they never did a wild thing unless it was your great uncle swithin who i believe was once swindled at thimble rig and was called four in hand forsyte because he drove a pair <\s>
<s> their day is passing and their type not altogether for the advantage of the country <\s>
<s> they were pedestrian but they too were sound <\s>
<s> i am the fourth jolyon forsyte a poor holder of the name no dad said jolly and holly squeezed his hand <\s>
<s> yes repeated jolyon a poor specimen representing i'm afraid nothing but the end of the century unearned income amateurism and individual liberty a different thing from individualism jolly <\s>
<s> you are the fifth jolyon forsyte old man and you open the ball of the new century <\s>
<s> as he spoke they turned in through the college gates and holly said it's fascinating dad <\s>
<s> none of them quite knew what she meant <\s>
<s> the rainbow distinguished as only an oxford hostel can be for lack of modernity provided one small oak panelled private sitting room in which holly sat to receive white frocked shy and alone when the only guest arrived <\s>
<s> rather as one would touch a moth val took her hand <\s>
<s> and wouldn't she wear this measly flower <\s>
<s> it would look ripping in her hair <\s>
<s> he removed a gardenia from his coat <\s>
<s> no thank you i couldn't <\s>
