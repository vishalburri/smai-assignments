<s> the light fell softly there so that he would not be worried by the gradual dying of the day and she began to talk to him about himself <\s>
<s> presently over james came a change like the mellowing that steals upon a fruit in the sun a sense of being caressed and praised and petted and all without the bestowal of a single caress or word of praise <\s>
<s> he felt that what he was eating was agreeing with him he could not get that feeling at home he did not know when he had enjoyed a glass of champagne so much and on inquiring the brand and price was surprised to find that it was one of which he had a large stock himself but could never drink he instantly formed the resolution to let his wine merchant know that he had been swindled <\s>
<s> looking up from his food he remarked you've a lot of nice things about the place <\s>
<s> now what did you give for that sugar sifter <\s>
<s> shouldn't wonder if it was worth money <\s>
<s> he was particularly pleased with the appearance of a picture on the wall opposite which he himself had given them i'd no idea it was so good <\s>
<s> they rose to go into the drawing room and james followed irene closely <\s>
<s> that's what i call a capital little dinner he murmured breathing pleasantly down on her shoulder nothing heavy and not too frenchified <\s>
<s> he stole back to the dining room unnoticed <\s>
<s> chapter vi james at large it was not long before soames's determination to build went the round of the family and created the flutter that any decision connected with property should make among forsytes <\s>
<s> it was not his fault for he had been determined that no one should know <\s>
<s> june in the fulness of her heart had told mrs <\s>
<s> small giving her leave only to tell aunt ann she thought it would cheer her the poor old sweet <\s>
<s> for aunt ann had kept her room now for many days <\s>
<s> small told aunt ann at once who smiling as she lay back on her pillows said in her distinct trembling old voice it's very nice for dear june but i hope they will be careful it's rather dangerous <\s>
<s> when she was left alone again a frown like a cloud presaging a rainy morrow crossed her face <\s>
<s> while she was lying there so many days the process of recharging her will went on all the time it spread to her face too and tightening movements were always in action at the corners of her lips <\s>
<s> the maid smither who had been in her service since girlhood and was spoken of as smither a good girl but so slow the maid smither performed every morning with extreme punctiliousness the crowning ceremony of that ancient toilet <\s>
<s> taking from the recesses of their pure white band box those flat grey curls the insignia of personal dignity she placed them securely in her mistress's hands and turned her back <\s>
<s> and every day aunts juley and hester were required to come and report on timothy what news there was of nicholas whether dear june had succeeded in getting jolyon to shorten the engagement now that mr <\s>
<s> bosinney was building soames a house whether young roger's wife was really expecting how the operation on archie had succeeded and what swithin had done about that empty house in wigmore street where the tenant had lost all his money and treated him so badly above all about soames was irene still still asking for a separate room <\s>
<s> and every morning smither was told i shall be coming down this afternoon smither about two o'clock <\s>
<s> i shall want your arm after all these days in bed <\s>
<s> after telling aunt ann mrs <\s>
<s> small had spoken of the house in the strictest confidence to mrs <\s>
<s> nicholas who in her turn had asked winifred dartie for confirmation supposing of course that being soames's sister she would know all about it <\s>
<s> through her it had in due course come round to the ears of james <\s>
<s> he had been a good deal agitated <\s>
<s> nobody he said told him anything <\s>
<s> and rather than go direct to soames himself of whose taciturnity he was afraid he took his umbrella and went round to timothy's <\s>
<s> septimus and hester who had been told she was so safe she found it tiring to talk ready and indeed eager to discuss the news <\s>
<s> it was very good of dear soames they thought to employ mr <\s>
<s> bosinney but rather risky <\s>
<s> what had george named him <\s>
<s> the buccaneer how droll <\s>
<s> but george was always droll <\s>
<s> however it would be all in the family they supposed they must really look upon mr <\s>
<s> bosinney as belonging to the family though it seemed strange <\s>
<s> james here broke in nobody knows anything about him <\s>
<s> i don't see what soames wants with a young man like that <\s>
<s> i shouldn't be surprised if irene had put her oar in <\s>
<s> i shall speak to .... <\s>
<s> soames interposed aunt juley told mr <\s>
<s> bosinney that he didn't wish it mentioned <\s>
<s> he wouldn't like it to be talked about i'm sure and if timothy knew he would be very vexed i .... <\s>
<s> james put his hand behind his ear what <\s>
<s> i'm getting very deaf <\s>
<s> i suppose i don't hear people <\s>
<s> emily's got a bad toe <\s>
<s> we shan't be able to start for wales till the end of the month <\s>
<s> and having got what he wanted he took his hat and went away <\s>
<s> it was a fine afternoon and he walked across the park towards soames's where he intended to dine for emily's toe kept her in bed and rachel and cicely were on a visit to the country <\s>
<s> he took the slanting path from the bayswater side of the row to the knightsbridge gate across a pasture of short burnt grass dotted with blackened sheep strewn with seated couples and strange waifs lying prone on their faces like corpses on a field over which the wave of battle has rolled <\s>
<s> he walked rapidly his head bent looking neither to right nor left <\s>
<s> the appearance of this park the centre of his own battle field where he had all his life been fighting excited no thought or speculation in his mind <\s>
<s> these corpses flung down there from out the press and turmoil of the struggle these pairs of lovers sitting cheek by jowl for an hour of idle elysium snatched from the monotony of their treadmill awakened no fancies in his mind he had outlived that kind of imagination his nose like the nose of a sheep was fastened to the pastures on which he browsed <\s>
<s> one of his tenants had lately shown a disposition to be behind hand in his rent and it had become a grave question whether he had not better turn him out at once and so run the risk of not re letting before christmas <\s>
<s> swithin had just been let in very badly but it had served him right he had held on too long <\s>
<s> he pondered this as he walked steadily holding his umbrella carefully by the wood just below the crook of the handle so as to keep the ferule off the ground and not fray the silk in the middle <\s>
<s> and with his thin high shoulders stooped his long legs moving with swift mechanical precision this passage through the park where the sun shone with a clear flame on so much idleness on so many human evidences of the remorseless battle of property raging beyond its ring was like the flight of some land bird across the sea <\s>
<s> he felt a touch on the arm as he came out at albert gate <\s>
<s> it was soames who crossing from the shady side of piccadilly where he had been walking home from the office had suddenly appeared alongside <\s>
<s> your mother's in bed said james i was just coming to you but i suppose i shall be in the way <\s>
<s> the outward relations between james and his son were marked by a lack of sentiment peculiarly forsytean but for all that the two were by no means unattached <\s>
<s> perhaps they regarded one another as an investment certainly they were solicitous of each other's welfare glad of each other's company <\s>
<s> they had never exchanged two words upon the more intimate problems of life or revealed in each other's presence the existence of any deep feeling <\s>
<s> something beyond the power of word analysis bound them together something hidden deep in the fibre of nations and families for blood they say is thicker than water and neither of them was a cold blooded man <\s>
<s> indeed in james love of his children was now the prime motive of his existence <\s>
<s> to have creatures who were parts of himself to whom he might transmit the money he saved was at the root of his saving and at seventy five what was left that could give him pleasure but saving <\s>
<s> the kernel of life was in this saving for his children <\s>
<s> than james forsyte notwithstanding all his jonah isms there was no saner man if the leading symptom of sanity as we are told is self preservation though without doubt timothy went too far in all this london of which he owned so much and loved with such a dumb love as the centre of his opportunities <\s>
<s> he had the marvellous instinctive sanity of the middle class <\s>
<s> in him more than in jolyon with his masterful will and his moments of tenderness and philosophy more than in swithin the martyr to crankiness nicholas the sufferer from ability and roger the victim of enterprise beat the true pulse of compromise of all the brothers he was least remarkable in mind and person and for that reason more likely to live for ever <\s>
<s> to james more than to any of the others was the family significant and dear <\s>
<s> there had always been something primitive and cosy in his attitude towards life he loved the family hearth he loved gossip and he loved grumbling <\s>
<s> all his decisions were formed of a cream which he skimmed off the family mind and through that family off the minds of thousands of other families of similar fibre <\s>
<s> year after year week after week he went to timothy's and in his brother's front drawing room his legs twisted his long white whiskers framing his clean shaven mouth would sit watching the family pot simmer the cream rising to the top and he would go away sheltered refreshed comforted with an indefinable sense of comfort <\s>
<s> beneath the adamant of his self preserving instinct there was much real softness in james a visit to timothy's was like an hour spent in the lap of a mother and the deep craving he himself had for the protection of the family wing reacted in turn on his feelings towards his own children it was a nightmare to him to think of them exposed to the treatment of the world in money health or reputation <\s>
<s> when his old friend john street's son volunteered for special service he shook his head querulously and wondered what john street was about to allow it and when young street was assagaied he took it so much to heart that he made a point of calling everywhere with the special object of saying he knew how it would be he'd no patience with them <\s>
<s> when his son in law dartie had that financial crisis due to speculation in oil shares james made himself ill worrying over it the knell of all prosperity seemed to have sounded <\s>
<s> it took him three months and a visit to baden baden to get better there was something terrible in the idea that but for his james's money dartie's name might have appeared in the bankruptcy list <\s>
<s> composed of a physiological mixture so sound that if he had an earache he thought he was dying he regarded the occasional ailments of his wife and children as in the nature of personal grievances special interventions of providence for the purpose of destroying his peace of mind but he did not believe at all in the ailments of people outside his own immediate family affirming them in every case to be due to neglected liver <\s>
<s> his universal comment was what can they expect <\s>
<s> i have it myself if i'm not careful <\s>
<s> when he went to soames's that evening he felt that life was hard on him there was emily with a bad toe and rachel gadding about in the country he got no sympathy from anybody and ann she was ill he did not believe she would last through the summer he had called there three times now without her being able to see him <\s>
<s> and this idea of soames's building a house that would have to be looked into <\s>
<s> as to the trouble with irene he didn't know what was to come of that anything might come of it <\s>
<s> he entered 62 montpellier square with the fullest intentions of being miserable <\s>
<s> it was already half past seven and irene dressed for dinner was seated in the drawing room <\s>
<s> she was wearing her gold coloured frock for having been displayed at a dinner party a soiree and a dance it was now to be worn at home and she had adorned the bosom with a cascade of lace on which james's eyes riveted themselves at once <\s>
<s> where do you get your things <\s>
<s> he said in an aggravated voice <\s>
<s> i never see rachel and cicely looking half so well <\s>
<s> that rose point now that's not real <\s>
<s> irene came close to prove to him that he was in error <\s>
<s> and in spite of himself james felt the influence of her deference of the faint seductive perfume exhaling from her <\s>
<s> no self respecting forsyte surrendered at a blow so he merely said he didn't know he expected she was spending a pretty penny on dress <\s>
<s> the gong sounded and putting her white arm within his irene took him into the dining room <\s>
<s> she seated him in soames's usual place round the corner on her left <\s>
<s> the light fell softly there so that he would not be worried by the gradual dying of the day and she began to talk to him about himself <\s>
<s> presently over james came a change like the mellowing that steals upon a fruit in the sun a sense of being caressed and praised and petted and all without the bestowal of a single caress or word of praise <\s>
<s> he felt that what he was eating was agreeing with him he could not get that feeling at home he did not know when he had enjoyed a glass of champagne so much and on inquiring the brand and price was surprised to find that it was one of which he had a large stock himself but could never drink he instantly formed the resolution to let his wine merchant know that he had been swindled <\s>
<s> looking up from his food he remarked you've a lot of nice things about the place <\s>
<s> now what did you give for that sugar sifter <\s>
<s> shouldn't wonder if it was worth money <\s>
<s> he was particularly pleased with the appearance of a picture on the wall opposite which he himself had given them i'd no idea it was so good <\s>
<s> they rose to go into the drawing room and james followed irene closely <\s>
<s> that's what i call a capital little dinner he murmured breathing pleasantly down on her shoulder nothing heavy and not too frenchified <\s>
