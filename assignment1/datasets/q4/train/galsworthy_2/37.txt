<s> yet with hereditary tenacity he stuck to the trail through vapour that blotted out everything but the shadow of the hunted man and the dim moon of the nearest lamp <\s>
<s> then suddenly with the instinct of a town stroller george knew himself to be in piccadilly <\s>
<s> here he could find his way blindfold and freed from the strain of geographical uncertainty his mind returned to bosinney's trouble <\s>
<s> down the long avenue of his man about town experience bursting as it were through a smirch of doubtful amours there stalked to him a memory of his youth <\s>
<s> a memory poignant still that brought the scent of hay the gleam of moonlight a summer magic into the reek and blackness of this london fog the memory of a night when in the darkest shadow of a lawn he had overheard from a woman's lips that he was not her sole possessor <\s>
<s> and for a moment george walked no longer in black piccadilly but lay again with hell in his heart and his face to the sweet smelling dewy grass in the long shadow of poplars that hid the moon <\s>
<s> a longing seized him to throw his arm round the buccaneer and say come old boy <\s>
<s> let's go and drink it off <\s>
<s> but a voice yelled at him and he started back <\s>
<s> a cab rolled out of blackness and into blackness disappeared <\s>
<s> and suddenly george perceived that he had lost bosinney <\s>
<s> he ran forward and back felt his heart clutched by a sickening fear the dark fear which lives in the wings of the fog <\s>
<s> perspiration started out on his brow <\s>
<s> he stood quite still listening with all his might <\s>
<s> and then as he confided to dartie the same evening in the course of a game of billiards at the red pottle i lost him <\s>
<s> dartie twirled complacently at his dark moustache <\s>
<s> he had just put together a neat break of twenty three failing at a jenny <\s>
<s> and who was she <\s>
<s> george looked slowly at the man of the world's fattish sallow face and a little grim smile lurked about the curves of his cheeks and his heavy lidded eyes <\s>
<s> no no my fine fellow he thought i'm not going to tell you <\s>
<s> for though he mixed with dartie a good deal he thought him a bit of a cad <\s>
<s> oh some little love lady or other he said and chalked his cue <\s>
<s> exclaimed dartie he used a more figurative expression <\s>
<s> i made sure it was our friend soa .... <\s>
<s> then damme you've made an error <\s>
<s> he missed his shot <\s>
<s> he was careful not to allude to the subject again till towards eleven o'clock having in his poetic phraseology looked upon the drink when it was yellow he drew aside the blind and gazed out into the street <\s>
<s> the murky blackness of the fog was but faintly broken by the lamps of the red pottle and no shape of mortal man or thing was in sight <\s>
<s> i can't help thinking of that poor buccaneer he said <\s>
<s> he may be wandering out there now in that fog <\s>
<s> if he's not a corpse he added with strange dejection <\s>
<s> said dartie in whom the recollection of his defeat at richmond flared up <\s>
<s> ten to one if he wasn't tight <\s>
<s> george turned on him looking really formidable with a sort of savage gloom on his big face <\s>
<s> don't i tell you he's taken the knock chapter v the trial in the morning of his case which was second in the list soames was again obliged to start without seeing irene and it was just as well for he had not as yet made up his mind what attitude to adopt towards her <\s>
<s> he had been requested to be in court by half past ten to provide against the event of the first action a breach of promise collapsing which however it did not both sides showing a courage that afforded waterbuck q c an opportunity for improving his already great reputation in this class of case <\s>
<s> he was opposed by ram the other celebrated breach of promise man <\s>
<s> it was a battle of giants <\s>
<s> the court delivered judgment just before the luncheon interval <\s>
<s> the jury left the box for good and soames went out to get something to eat <\s>
<s> he met james standing at the little luncheon bar like a pelican in the wilderness of the galleries bent over a sandwich with a glass of sherry before him <\s>
<s> the spacious emptiness of the great central hall over which father and son brooded as they stood together was marred now and then for a fleeting moment by barristers in wig and gown hurriedly bolting across by an occasional old lady or rusty coated man looking up in a frightened way and by two persons bolder than their generation seated in an embrasure arguing <\s>
<s> the sound of their voices arose together with a scent as of neglected wells which mingling with the odour of the galleries combined to form the savour like nothing but the emanation of a refined cheese so indissolubly connected with the administration of british justice <\s>
<s> it was not long before james addressed his son <\s>
<s> when's your case coming on <\s>
<s> i suppose it'll be on directly <\s>
<s> i shouldn't wonder if this bosinney'd say anything i should think he'd have to <\s>
<s> he'll go bankrupt if it goes against him <\s>
<s> he took a large bite at his sandwich and a mouthful of sherry <\s>
<s> your mother he said wants you and irene to come and dine to night <\s>
<s> a chill smile played round soames lips he looked back at his father <\s>
<s> anyone who had seen the look cold and furtive thus interchanged might have been pardoned for not appreciating the real understanding between them <\s>
<s> james finished his sherry at a draught <\s>
<s> on returning to the court soames took at once his rightful seat on the front bench beside his solicitor <\s>
<s> he ascertained where his father was seated with a glance so sidelong as to commit nobody <\s>
<s> james sitting back with his hands clasped over the handle of his umbrella was brooding on the end of the bench immediately behind counsel whence he could get away at once when the case was over <\s>
<s> he considered bosinney's conduct in every way outrageous but he did not wish to run up against him feeling that the meeting would be awkward <\s>
<s> next to the divorce court this court was perhaps the favourite emporium of justice libel breach of promise and other commercial actions being frequently decided there <\s>
<s> quite a sprinkling of persons unconnected with the law occupied the back benches and the hat of a woman or two could be seen in the gallery <\s>
<s> the two rows of seats immediately in front of james were gradually filled by barristers in wigs who sat down to make pencil notes chat and attend to their teeth but his interest was soon diverted from these lesser lights of justice by the entrance of waterbuck q c with the wings of his silk gown rustling and his red capable face supported by two short brown whiskers <\s>
<s> the famous q c <\s>
<s> looked as james freely admitted the very picture of a man who could heckle a witness <\s>
<s> for all his experience it so happened that he had never seen waterbuck q c before and like many forsytes in the lower branch of the profession he had an extreme admiration for a good cross examiner <\s>
<s> the long lugubrious folds in his cheeks relaxed somewhat after seeing him especially as he now perceived that soames alone was represented by silk <\s>
<s> waterbuck q c had barely screwed round on his elbow to chat with his junior before mr <\s>
<s> justice bentham himself appeared a thin rather hen like man with a little stoop clean shaven under his snowy wig <\s>
<s> like all the rest of the court waterbuck rose and remained on his feet until the judge was seated <\s>
<s> james rose but slightly he was already comfortable and had no opinion of bentham having sat next but one to him at dinner twice at the bumley tomms <\s>
<s> bumley tomm was rather a poor thing though he had been so successful <\s>
<s> james himself had given him his first brief <\s>
<s> he was excited too for he had just found out that bosinney was not in court <\s>
<s> now what's he mean by that <\s>
<s> he kept on thinking <\s>
<s> the case having been called on waterbuck q c pushing back his papers hitched his gown on his shoulder and with a semi circular look around him like a man who is going to bat arose and addressed the court <\s>
<s> the facts he said were not in dispute and all that his lordship would be asked was to interpret the correspondence which had taken place between his client and the defendant an architect with reference to the decoration of a house <\s>
<s> he would however submit that this correspondence could only mean one very plain thing <\s>
<s> after briefly reciting the history of the house at robin hill which he described as a mansion and the actual facts of expenditure he went on as follows my client mr <\s>
<s> soames forsyte is a gentleman a man of property who would be the last to dispute any legitimate claim that might be made against him but he has met with such treatment from his architect in the matter of this house over which he has as your lordship has heard already spent some twelve some twelve thousand pounds a sum considerably in advance of the amount he had originally contemplated that as a matter of principle and this i cannot too strongly emphasize as a matter of principle and in the interests of others he has felt himself compelled to bring this action <\s>
<s> the point put forward in defence by the architect i will suggest to your lordship is not worthy of a moment's serious consideration <\s>
<s> he then read the correspondence <\s>
<s> his client a man of recognised position was prepared to go into the box and to swear that he never did authorize that it was never in his mind to authorize the expenditure of any money beyond the extreme limit of twelve thousand and fifty pounds which he had clearly fixed and not further to waste the time of the court he would at once call mr <\s>
<s> soames then went into the box <\s>
<s> his whole appearance was striking in its composure <\s>
<s> his face just supercilious enough pale and clean shaven with a little line between the eyes and compressed lips his dress in unostentatious order one hand neatly gloved the other bare <\s>
<s> he answered the questions put to him in a somewhat low but distinct voice <\s>
<s> his evidence under cross examination savoured of taciturnity <\s>
<s> had he not used the expression a free hand <\s>
<s> the expression he had used was a free hand in the terms of this correspondence <\s>
<s> would you tell the court that that was english <\s>
<s> what do you say it means <\s>
<s> are you prepared to deny that it is a contradiction in terms <\s>
<s> you are not an irishman <\s>
<s> are you a well educated man <\s>
<s> and yet you persist in that statement <\s>
<s> throughout this and much more cross examination which turned again and again around the nice point james sat with his hand behind his ear his eyes fixed upon his son <\s>
<s> he was proud of him <\s>
<s> he could not but feel that in similar circumstances he himself would have been tempted to enlarge his replies but his instinct told him that this taciturnity was the very thing <\s>
<s> he sighed with relief however when soames slowly turning and without any change of expression descended from the box <\s>
<s> when it came to the turn of bosinney's counsel to address the judge james redoubled his attention and he searched the court again and again to see if bosinney were not somewhere concealed <\s>
<s> young chankery began nervously he was placed by bosinney's absence in an awkward position <\s>
