<s> he had long forgotten how he had hovered lanky and pale in side whiskers of chestnut hue round emily in the days of his own courtship <\s>
<s> but i wasn't sure of it he said till i saw him pick up her handkerchief <\s>
<s> small's eyes boiled with excitement <\s>
<s> and did he give it her back <\s>
<s> said swithin i saw him slobber on it when he thought i wasn't looking <\s>
<s> small gasped too interested to speak <\s>
<s> but she gave him no encouragement went on swithin he stopped and stared for a minute or two in the way that alarmed aunt hester so he had suddenly recollected that as they were starting back in the phaeton she had given bosinney her hand a second time and let it stay there too .... <\s>
<s> he had touched his horses smartly with the whip anxious to get her all to himself <\s>
<s> but she had looked back and she had not answered his first question neither had he been able to see her face she had kept it hanging down <\s>
<s> there is somewhere a picture which swithin has not seen of a man sitting on a rock and by him immersed in the still green water a sea nymph lying on her back with her hand on her naked breast <\s>
<s> she has a half smile on her face a smile of hopeless surrender and of secret joy <\s>
<s> seated by swithin's side irene may have been smiling like that <\s>
<s> when warmed by champagne he had her all to himself he unbosomed himself of his wrongs of his smothered resentment against the new chef at the club his worry over the house in wigmore street where the rascally tenant had gone bankrupt through helping his brother in law as if charity did not begin at home of his deafness too and that pain he sometimes got in his right side <\s>
<s> she listened her eyes swimming under their lids <\s>
<s> he thought she was thinking deeply of his troubles and pitied himself terribly <\s>
<s> yet in his fur coat with frogs across the breast his top hat aslant driving this beautiful woman he had never felt more distinguished <\s>
<s> a coster however taking his girl for a sunday airing seemed to have the same impression about himself <\s>
<s> this person had flogged his donkey into a gallop alongside and sat upright as a waxwork in his shallopy chariot his chin settled pompously on a red handkerchief like swithin's on his full cravat while his girl with the ends of a fly blown boa floating out behind aped a woman of fashion <\s>
<s> her swain moved a stick with a ragged bit of string dangling from the end reproducing with strange fidelity the circular flourish of swithin's whip and rolled his head at his lady with a leer that had a weird likeness to swithin's primeval stare <\s>
<s> though for a time unconscious of the lowly ruffian's presence swithin presently took it into his head that he was being guyed <\s>
<s> he laid his whip lash across the mares flank <\s>
<s> the two chariots however by some unfortunate fatality continued abreast <\s>
<s> swithin's yellow puffy face grew red he raised his whip to lash the costermonger but was saved from so far forgetting his dignity by a special intervention of providence <\s>
<s> a carriage driving out through a gate forced phaeton and donkey cart into proximity the wheels grated the lighter vehicle skidded and was overturned <\s>
<s> swithin did not look round <\s>
<s> on no account would he have pulled up to help the ruffian <\s>
<s> serve him right if he had broken his neck <\s>
<s> but he could not if he would <\s>
<s> the greys had taken alarm <\s>
<s> the phaeton swung from side to side and people raised frightened faces as they went dashing past <\s>
<s> swithin's great arms stretched at full length tugged at the reins <\s>
<s> his cheeks were puffed his lips compressed his swollen face was of a dull angry red <\s>
<s> irene had her hand on the rail and at every lurch she gripped it tightly <\s>
<s> swithin heard her ask are we going to have an accident uncle swithin <\s>
<s> he gasped out between his pants it's nothing a little fresh <\s>
<s> i've never been in an accident <\s>
<s> he took a look at her <\s>
<s> she was smiling perfectly calm <\s>
<s> sit still he repeated <\s>
<s> never fear i'll get you home <\s>
<s> and in the midst of all his terrible efforts he was surprised to hear her answer in a voice not like her own i don't care if i never get home <\s>
<s> the carriage giving a terrific lurch swithin's exclamation was jerked back into his throat <\s>
<s> the horses winded by the rise of a hill now steadied to a trot and finally stopped of their own accord <\s>
<s> when swithin described it at timothy's i pulled em up there she was as cool as myself <\s>
<s> god bless my soul <\s>
<s> she behaved as if she didn't care whether she broke her neck or not <\s>
<s> what was it she said i don't care if i never get home <\s>
<s> leaning over the handle of his cane he wheezed out to mrs <\s>
<s> small's terror and i'm not altogether surprised with a finickin feller like young soames for a husband <\s>
<s> it did not occur to him to wonder what bosinney had done after they had left him there alone whether he had gone wandering about like the dog to which swithin had compared him wandering down to that copse where the spring was still in riot the cuckoo still calling from afar gone down there with her handkerchief pressed to lips its fragrance mingling with the scent of mint and thyme <\s>
<s> gone down there with such a wild exquisite pain in his heart that he could have cried out among the trees <\s>
<s> or what indeed the fellow had done <\s>
<s> in fact till he came to timothy's swithin had forgotten all about him <\s>
<s> chapter iv james goes to see for himself those ignorant of forsyte change would not perhaps foresee all the stir made by irene's visit to the house <\s>
<s> after swithin had related at timothy's the full story of his memorable drive the same with the least suspicion of curiosity the merest touch of malice and a real desire to do good was passed on to june <\s>
<s> and what a dreadful thing to say my dear <\s>
<s> ended aunt juley that about not going home <\s>
<s> what did she mean <\s>
<s> it was a strange recital for the girl <\s>
<s> she heard it flushing painfully and suddenly with a curt handshake took her departure <\s>
<s> small said to aunt hester when june was gone <\s>
<s> the proper construction was put on her reception of the news <\s>
<s> something was therefore very wrong <\s>
<s> she and irene had been such friends <\s>
<s> it all tallied too well with whispers and hints that had been going about for some time past <\s>
<s> recollections of euphemia's account of the visit to the theatre mr <\s>
<s> bosinney always at soames's <\s>
<s> yes of course he would be about the house <\s>
<s> only upon the greatest the most important provocation was it necessary to say anything open on forsyte change <\s>
<s> this machine was too nicely adjusted a hint the merest trifling expression of regret or doubt sufficed to set the family soul so sympathetic vibrating <\s>
<s> no one desired that harm should come of these vibrations far from it they were set in motion with the best intentions with the feeling that each member of the family had a stake in the family soul <\s>
<s> and much kindness lay at the bottom of the gossip it would frequently result in visits of condolence being made in accordance with the customs of society thereby conferring a real benefit upon the sufferers and affording consolation to the sound who felt pleasantly that someone at all events was suffering from that from which they themselves were not suffering <\s>
<s> in fact it was simply a desire to keep things well aired the desire which animates the public press that brought james for instance into communication with mrs <\s>
<s> septimus with the little nicholases the little nicholases with who knows whom and so on <\s>
<s> that great class to which they had risen and now belonged demanded a certain candour a still more certain reticence <\s>
<s> this combination guaranteed their membership <\s>
<s> many of the younger forsytes felt very naturally and would openly declare that they did not want their affairs pried into but so powerful was the invisible magnetic current of family gossip that for the life of them they could not help knowing all about everything <\s>
<s> it was felt to be hopeless <\s>
<s> one of them young roger had made an heroic attempt to free the rising generation by speaking of timothy as an old cat <\s>
<s> the effort had justly recoiled upon himself the words coming round in the most delicate way to aunt juley's ears were repeated by her in a shocked voice to mrs <\s>
<s> roger whence they returned again to young roger <\s>
<s> and after all it was only the wrong doers who suffered as for instance george when he lost all that money playing billiards or young roger himself when he was so dreadfully near to marrying the girl to whom it was whispered he was already married by the laws of nature or again irene who was thought rather than said to be in danger <\s>
<s> all this was not only pleasant but salutary <\s>
<s> and it made so many hours go lightly at timothy's in the bayswater road so many hours that must otherwise have been sterile and heavy to those three who lived there and timothy's was but one of hundreds of such homes in this city of london the homes of neutral persons of the secure classes who are out of the battle themselves and must find their reason for existing in the battles of others <\s>
<s> but for the sweetness of family gossip it must indeed have been lonely there <\s>
<s> rumours and tales reports surmises were they not the children of the house as dear and precious as the prattling babes the brother and sisters had missed in their own journey <\s>
<s> to talk about them was as near as they could get to the possession of all those children and grandchildren after whom their soft hearts yearned <\s>
<s> for though it is doubtful whether timothy's heart yearned it is indubitable that at the arrival of each fresh forsyte child he was quite upset <\s>
<s> useless for young roger to say old cat <\s>
<s> for euphemia to hold up her hands and cry oh <\s>
<s> and break into her silent laugh with the squeak at the end <\s>
<s> useless and not too kind <\s>
<s> the situation which at this stage might seem and especially to forsyte eyes strange not to say impossible' was in view of certain facts not so strange after all <\s>
<s> some things had been lost sight of <\s>
<s> and first in the security bred of many harmless marriages it had been forgotten that love is no hot house flower but a wild plant born of a wet night born of an hour of sunshine sprung from wild seed blown along the road by a wild wind <\s>
<s> a wild plant that when it blooms by chance within the hedge of our gardens we call a flower and when it blooms outside we call a weed but flower or weed whose scent and colour are always wild <\s>
