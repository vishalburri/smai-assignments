<s> how can one talk .... <\s>
<s> june's first thought was to go away but instead she crossed to the long window opening on the little court <\s>
<s> it was from there that the scent of the azaleas came and standing with their backs to her their faces buried in the golden pink blossoms stood her lover and irene <\s>
<s> silent but unashamed with flaming cheeks and angry eyes the girl watched <\s>
<s> come on sunday by yourself we can go over the house together <\s>
<s> june saw irene look up at him through her screen of blossoms <\s>
<s> it was not the look of a coquette but far worse to the watching girl of a woman fearful lest that look should say too much <\s>
<s> i've promised to go for a drive with uncle .... <\s>
<s> make him bring you it's only ten miles the very thing for his horses <\s>
<s> poor old uncle swithin <\s>
<s> a wave of the azalea scent drifted into june's face she felt sick and dizzy <\s>
<s> i must see you there i thought you'd like to help me .... <\s>
<s> the answer seemed to the girl to come softly with a tremble from amongst the blossoms so i do <\s>
<s> and she stepped into the open space of the window <\s>
<s> how stuffy it is here <\s>
<s> she said i can't bear this scent <\s>
<s> her eyes so angry and direct swept both their faces <\s>
<s> were you talking about the house <\s>
<s> i haven't seen it yet you know shall we all go on sunday from irene's face the colour had flown <\s>
<s> i am going for a drive that day with uncle swithin she answered <\s>
<s> what does he matter <\s>
<s> you can throw him over <\s>
<s> i am not in the habit of throwing people over <\s>
<s> there was a sound of footsteps and june saw soames standing just behind her <\s>
<s> if you are all ready said irene looking from one to the other with a strange smile dinner is too <\s>
<s> chapter ii june's treat dinner began in silence the women facing one another and the men <\s>
<s> in silence the soup was finished excellent if a little thick and fish was brought <\s>
<s> in silence it was handed <\s>
<s> bosinney ventured it's the first spring day <\s>
<s> irene echoed softly yes the first spring day <\s>
<s> said june there isn't a breath of air <\s>
<s> the fish was taken away a fine fresh sole from dover <\s>
<s> and bilson brought champagne a bottle swathed around the neck with white .... <\s>
<s> soames said you'll find it dry <\s>
<s> cutlets were handed each pink frilled about the legs <\s>
<s> they were refused by june and silence fell <\s>
<s> soames said you'd better take a cutlet june there's nothing coming <\s>
<s> but june again refused so they were borne away <\s>
<s> and then irene asked phil have you heard my blackbird <\s>
<s> bosinney answered rather he's got a hunting song <\s>
<s> as i came round i heard him in the square <\s>
<s> but he went away with the resolution to see her again <\s>
<s> he effected his object by chance meeting her on the pier with her stepmother who had the habit of walking there from twelve to one of a forenoon <\s>
<s> soames made this lady's acquaintance with alacrity nor was it long before he perceived in her the ally he was looking for <\s>
<s> his keen scent for the commercial side of family life soon told him that irene cost her stepmother more than the fifty pounds a year she brought her it also told him that mrs <\s>
<s> heron a woman yet in the prime of life desired to be married again <\s>
<s> the strange ripening beauty of her stepdaughter stood in the way of this desirable consummation <\s>
<s> and soames in his stealthy tenacity laid his plans <\s>
<s> he left bournemouth without having given himself away but in a month's time came back and this time he spoke not to the girl but to her stepmother <\s>
<s> he had made up his mind he said he would wait any time <\s>
<s> and he had long to wait watching irene bloom the lines of her young figure softening the stronger blood deepening the gleam of her eyes and warming her face to a creamy glow and at each visit he proposed to her and when that visit was at an end took her refusal away with him back to london sore at heart but steadfast and silent as the grave <\s>
<s> he tried to come at the secret springs of her resistance only once had he a gleam of light <\s>
<s> it was at one of those assembly dances which afford the only outlet to the passions of the population of seaside watering places <\s>
<s> he was sitting with her in an embrasure his senses tingling with the contact of the waltz <\s>
<s> she had looked at him over her slowly waving fan and he had lost his head <\s>
<s> seizing that moving wrist he pressed his lips to the flesh of her arm <\s>
<s> and she had shuddered to this day he had not forgotten that shudder nor the look so passionately averse she had given him <\s>
<s> a year after that she had yielded <\s>
<s> what had made her yield he could never make out and from mrs <\s>
<s> heron a woman of some diplomatic talent he learnt nothing <\s>
<s> once after they were married he asked her what made you refuse me so often <\s>
<s> she had answered by a strange silence <\s>
<s> an enigma to him from the day that he first saw her she was an enigma to him still .... <\s>
<s> bosinney was waiting for him at the door and on his rugged good looking face was a queer yearning yet happy look as though he too saw a promise of bliss in the spring sky sniffed a coming happiness in the spring air <\s>
<s> soames looked at him waiting there <\s>
<s> what was the matter with the fellow that he looked so happy <\s>
<s> what was he waiting for with that smile on his lips and in his eyes <\s>
<s> soames could not see that for which bosinney was waiting as he stood there drinking in the flower scented wind <\s>
<s> and once more he felt baffled in the presence of this man whom by habit he despised <\s>
<s> he hastened on to the house <\s>
<s> the only colour for those tiles he heard bosinney say is ruby with a grey tint in the stuff to give a transparent effect <\s>
<s> i should like irene's opinion <\s>
<s> i'm ordering the purple leather curtains for the doorway of this court and if you distemper the drawing room ivory cream over paper you'll get an illusive look <\s>
<s> you want to aim all through the decorations at what i call charm <\s>
<s> soames said you mean that my wife has charm <\s>
<s> bosinney evaded the question <\s>
<s> you should have a clump of iris plants in the centre of that court <\s>
<s> i'll look into beech's some time he said and see what's appropriate <\s>
<s> they found little else to say to each other but on the way to the station soames asked i suppose you find irene very artistic <\s>
<s> the abrupt answer was as distinct a snub as saying if you want to discuss her you can do it with someone else <\s>
<s> and the slow sulky anger soames had felt all the afternoon burned the brighter within him <\s>
<s> neither spoke again till they were close to the station then soames asked when do you expect to have finished <\s>
<s> by the end of june if you really wish me to decorate as well <\s>
<s> but you quite understand he said that the house is costing me a lot beyond what i contemplated <\s>
<s> i may as well tell you that i should have thrown it up only i'm not in the habit of giving up what i've set my mind on <\s>
<s> bosinney made no reply <\s>
<s> and soames gave him askance a look of dogged dislike for in spite of his fastidious air and that supercilious dandified taciturnity soames with his set lips and squared chin was not unlike a bulldog .... <\s>
<s> when at seven o'clock that evening june arrived at 62 montpellier square the maid bilson told her that mr <\s>
<s> bosinney was in the drawing room the mistress she said was dressing and would be down in a minute <\s>
<s> she would tell her that miss june was here <\s>
<s> june stopped her at once <\s>
<s> all right bilson she said i'll just go in <\s>
<s> you needn't hurry mrs <\s>
<s> she took off her cloak and bilson with an understanding look did not even open the drawing room door for her but ran downstairs <\s>
<s> june paused for a moment to look at herself in the little old fashioned silver mirror above the oaken rug chest a slim imperious young figure with a small resolute face in a white frock cut moon shaped at the base of a neck too slender for her crown of twisted red gold hair <\s>
<s> she opened the drawing room door softly meaning to take him by surprise <\s>
<s> the room was filled with a sweet hot scent of flowering azaleas <\s>
<s> she took a long breath of the perfume and heard bosinney's voice not in the room but quite close saying <\s>
<s> there were such heaps of things i wanted to talk about and now we shan't have time <\s>
<s> irene's voice answered why not at dinner <\s>
<s> how can one talk .... <\s>
