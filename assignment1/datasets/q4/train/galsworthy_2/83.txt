<s> it may be stupid but there it is you see <\s>
<s> it isn't advisable in england to let people know that you ran a restaurant or kept a shop or were in any kind of trade <\s>
<s> it may have been extremely creditable but it puts a sort of label on you you don't have such a good time or meet such nice people that's all <\s>
<s> i see said annette it is the same in france <\s>
<s> murmured soames at once relieved and taken aback <\s>
<s> of course class is everything really <\s>
<s> yes said annette comme vous etes sage <\s>
<s> that's all right thought soames watching her lips only she's pretty cynical <\s>
<s> his knowledge of french was not yet such as to make him grieve that she had not said tu <\s>
<s> he slipped his arm round her and murmured with an effort et vous etes ma belle femme <\s>
<s> annette went off into a little fit of laughter <\s>
<s> ne parlez pas francais soames <\s>
<s> what is that old lady your aunt looking forward to <\s>
<s> soames bit his lip <\s>
<s> he said she's always saying something but he knew better than god <\s>
<s> chapter xi suspended animation the war dragged on <\s>
<s> nicholas had been heard to say that it would cost three hundred millions if it cost a penny before they'd done with it <\s>
<s> the income tax was seriously threatened <\s>
<s> still there would be south africa for their money once for all <\s>
<s> and though the possessive instinct felt badly shaken at three o'clock in the morning it recovered by breakfast time with the recollection that one gets nothing in this world without paying for it <\s>
<s> so on the whole people went about their business much as if there were no war no concentration camps no slippery de wet no feeling on the continent no anything unpleasant <\s>
<s> indeed the attitude of the nation was typified by timothy's map whose animation was suspended for timothy no longer moved the flags and they could not move themselves not even backwards and forwards as they should have done <\s>
<s> suspended animation went further it invaded forsyte change and produced a general uncertainty as to what was going to happen next <\s>
<s> the announcement in the marriage column of the times jolyon forsyte to irene only daughter of the late professor heron had occasioned doubt whether irene had been justly described <\s>
<s> and yet on the whole relief was felt that she had not been entered as irene late the wife or the divorced wife of soames forsyte <\s>
<s> altogether there had been a kind of sublimity from the first about the way the family had taken that affair <\s>
<s> as james had phrased it there it was <\s>
<s> no use to fuss <\s>
<s> nothing to be had out of admitting that it had been a nasty jar' in the phraseology of the day <\s>
<s> but what would happen now that both soames and jolyon were married again <\s>
<s> that was very intriguing <\s>
<s> george was known to have laid eustace six to four on a little jolyon before a little soames <\s>
<s> george was so droll <\s>
<s> it was rumoured too that he and dartie had a bet as to whether james would attain the age of ninety though which of them had backed james no one knew <\s>
<s> early in may winifred came round to say that val had been wounded in the leg by a spent bullet and was to be discharged <\s>

<s> he would have a little limp nothing to speak of <\s>
<s> he wanted his grandfather to buy him a farm out there where he could breed horses <\s>
<s> her father was giving holly eight hundred a year so they could be quite comfortable because his grandfather would give val five he had said but as to the farm he didn't know couldn't tell he didn't want val to go throwing away his money <\s>
<s> but you know said winifred he must do something <\s>
<s> aunt hester thought that perhaps his dear grandfather was wise because if he didn't buy a farm it couldn't turn out badly <\s>
<s> but val loves horses said winifred <\s>
<s> it'd be such an occupation for him <\s>
<s> aunt juley thought that horses were very uncertain had not montague found them so <\s>
<s> val's different said winifred he takes after me <\s>
<s> aunt juley was sure that dear val was very clever <\s>
<s> i always remember she added how he gave his bad penny to a beggar <\s>
<s> his dear grandfather was so pleased <\s>
<s> he thought it showed such presence of mind <\s>
<s> i remember his saying that he ought to go into the navy <\s>
<s> aunt hester chimed in did not winifred think that it was much better for the young people to be secure and not run any risk at their age <\s>
<s> well said winifred if they were in london perhaps in london it's amusing to do nothing <\s>
<s> but out there of course he'll simply get bored to death <\s>
<s> aunt hester thought that it would be nice for him to work if he were quite sure not to lose by it <\s>
