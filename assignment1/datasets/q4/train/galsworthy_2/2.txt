<s> aunt ann turned her old eyes from one to the other <\s>
<s> indulgent and severe was her look <\s>
<s> in turn the three brothers looked at ann <\s>
<s> she was getting shaky <\s>
<s> a man not to know what he had on <\s>
<s> what indeed was this young man who in becoming engaged to june old jolyon's acknowledged heiress had done so well for himself <\s>
<s> he was an architect not in itself a sufficient reason for wearing such a hat <\s>
<s> none of the forsytes happened to be architects but one of them knew two architects who would never have worn such a hat upon a call of ceremony in the london season <\s>
<s> june of course had not seen this but though not yet nineteen she was notorious <\s>
<s> had she not said to mrs <\s>
<s> soames who was always so beautifully dressed that feathers were vulgar <\s>
<s> soames had actually given up wearing feathers so dreadfully downright was dear june <\s>
<s> these misgivings this disapproval and perfectly genuine distrust did not prevent the forsytes from gathering to old jolyon's invitation <\s>
<s> an at home at stanhope gate was a great rarity none had been held for twelve years not indeed since old mrs <\s>
<s> never had there been so full an assembly for mysteriously united in spite of all their differences they had taken arms against a common peril <\s>
<s> like cattle when a dog comes into the field they stood head to head and shoulder to shoulder prepared to run upon and trample the invader to death <\s>
<s> they had come too no doubt to get some notion of what sort of presents they would ultimately be expected to give for though the question of wedding gifts was usually graduated in this way what are you givin <\s>
<s> nicholas is givin spoons so very much depended on the bridegroom <\s>
<s> if he were sleek well brushed prosperous looking it was more necessary to give him nice things he would expect them <\s>
<s> in the end each gave exactly what was right and proper by a species of family adjustment arrived at as prices are arrived at on the stock exchange the exact niceties being regulated at timothy's commodious red brick residence in bayswater overlooking the park where dwelt aunts ann juley and hester <\s>
<s> the uneasiness of the forsyte family has been justified by the simple mention of the hat <\s>
<s> how impossible and wrong would it have been for any family with the regard for appearances which should ever characterize the great upper middle class to feel otherwise than uneasy <\s>
<s> the author of the uneasiness stood talking to june by the further door his curly hair had a rumpled appearance as though he found what was going on around him unusual <\s>
<s> he had an air too of having a joke all to himself <\s>
<s> george speaking aside to his brother eustace said looks as if he might make a bolt of it the dashing buccaneer <\s>
<s> this very singular looking man as mrs <\s>
<s> small afterwards called him was of medium height and strong build with a pale brown face a dust coloured moustache very prominent cheek bones and hollow checks <\s>
<s> his forehead sloped back towards the crown of his head and bulged out in bumps over the eyes like foreheads seen in the lion house at the zoo <\s>
<s> he had sherry coloured eyes disconcertingly inattentive at times <\s>
<s> old jolyon's coachman after driving june and bosinney to the theatre had remarked to the butler i dunno what to make of im <\s>
<s> looks to me for all the world like an alf tame leopard <\s>
<s> and every now and then a forsyte would come up sidle round and take a look at him <\s>
<s> june stood in front fending off this idle curiosity a little bit of a thing as somebody once said all hair and spirit with fearless blue eyes a firm jaw and a bright colour whose face and body seemed too slender for her crown of red gold hair <\s>
<s> a tall woman with a beautiful figure which some member of the family had once compared to a heathen goddess stood looking at these two with a shadowy smile <\s>
<s> her hands gloved in french grey were crossed one over the other her grave charming face held to one side and the eyes of all men near were fastened on it <\s>
<s> her figure swayed so balanced that the very air seemed to set it moving <\s>
<s> there was warmth but little colour in her cheeks her large dark eyes were soft <\s>
<s> but it was at her lips asking a question giving an answer with that shadowy smile that men looked they were sensitive lips sensuous and sweet and through them seemed to come warmth and perfume like the warmth and perfume of a flower <\s>
<s> the engaged couple thus scrutinized were unconscious of this passive goddess <\s>
<s> it was bosinney who first noticed her and asked her name <\s>
<s> june took her lover up to the woman with the beautiful figure <\s>
<s> irene is my greatest chum she said please be good friends you two <\s>
<s> at the little lady's command they all three smiled and while they were smiling soames forsyte silently appearing from behind the woman with the beautiful figure who was his wife said ah <\s>
<s> he was seldom indeed far from irene's side at public functions and even when separated by the exigencies of social intercourse could be seen following her about with his eyes in which were strange expressions of watchfulness and longing <\s>
<s> at the window his father james was still scrutinizing the marks on the piece of china <\s>
<s> i wonder at jolyon's allowing this engagement he said to aunt ann <\s>
<s> they tell me there's no chance of their getting married for years <\s>
<s> this young bosinney he made the word a dactyl in opposition to general usage of a short o has got nothing <\s>
<s> when winifred married dartie i made him bring every penny into settlement lucky thing too they'd ha had nothing by this time <\s>
<s> aunt ann looked up from her velvet chair <\s>
<s> grey curls banded her forehead curls that unchanged for decades had extinguished in the family all sense of time <\s>
<s> she made no reply for she rarely spoke husbanding her aged voice but to james uneasy of conscience her look was as good as an answer <\s>
<s> well he said i couldn't help irene's having no money <\s>
<s> soames was in such a hurry he got quite thin dancing attendance on her <\s>
<s> putting the bowl pettishly down on the piano he let his eyes wander to the group by the door <\s>
<s> it's my opinion he said unexpectedly that it's just as well as it is <\s>
<s> aunt ann did not ask him to explain this strange utterance <\s>
<s> she knew what he was thinking <\s>
<s> if irene had no money she would not be so foolish as to do anything wrong for they said they said she had been asking for a separate room but of course soames had not .... <\s>
<s> james interrupted her reverie but where he asked was timothy <\s>
<s> hadn't he come with them <\s>
<s> through aunt ann's compressed lips a tender smile forced its way no he didn't think it wise with so much of this diphtheria about and he so liable to take things <\s>
<s> james answered well he takes good care of himself <\s>
<s> i can't afford to take the care of myself that he does <\s>
<s> nor was it easy to say which of admiration envy or contempt was dominant in that remark <\s>
<s> timothy indeed was seldom seen <\s>
<s> the baby of the family a publisher by profession he had some years before when business was at full tide scented out the stagnation which indeed had not yet come but which ultimately as all agreed was bound to set in and selling his share in a firm engaged mainly in the production of religious books had invested the quite conspicuous proceeds in three per cent <\s>
<s> by this act he had at once assumed an isolated position no other forsyte being content with less than four per cent <\s>
<s> for his money and this isolation had slowly and surely undermined a spirit perhaps better than commonly endowed with caution <\s>
<s> he had become almost a myth a kind of incarnation of security haunting the background of the forsyte universe <\s>
<s> he had never committed the imprudence of marrying or encumbering himself in any way with children <\s>
<s> james resumed tapping the piece of china this isn't real old worcester <\s>
<s> i s'pose jolyon's told you something about the young man <\s>
<s> from all i can learn he's got no business no income and no connection worth speaking of but then i know nothing nobody tells me anything <\s>
<s> aunt ann shook her head <\s>
<s> over her square chinned aquiline old face a trembling passed the spidery fingers of her hands pressed against each other and interlaced as though she were subtly recharging her will <\s>
<s> the eldest by some years of all the forsytes she held a peculiar position amongst them <\s>
<s> opportunists and egotists one and all though not indeed more so than their neighbours they quailed before her incorruptible figure and when opportunities were too strong what could they do but avoid her <\s>
<s> twisting his long thin legs james went on jolyon he will have his own way <\s>
<s> he's got no children and stopped recollecting the continued existence of old jolyon's son young jolyon june's father who had made such a mess of it and done for himself by deserting his wife and child and running away with that foreign governess <\s>
<s> well he resumed hastily if he likes to do these things i s'pose he can afford to <\s>
<s> now what's he going to give her <\s>
<s> i s'pose he'll give her a thousand a year he's got nobody else to leave his money to <\s>
<s> he stretched out his hand to meet that of a dapper clean shaven man with hardly a hair on his head a long broken nose full lips and cold grey eyes under rectangular brows <\s>
<s> well nick he muttered how are you <\s>
