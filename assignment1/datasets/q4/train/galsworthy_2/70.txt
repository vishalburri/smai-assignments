<s> take your time said jolly again i don't want to be unfair <\s>
<s> and they both looked at holly <\s>
<s> she had recoiled against the bookshelves reaching to the ceiling her dark head leaned against gibbon's roman empire her eyes in a sort of soft grey agony were fixed on val <\s>
<s> and he who had not much gift of insight had suddenly a gleam of vision <\s>
<s> she would be proud of her brother that enemy <\s>
<s> she would be ashamed of him <\s>
<s> his hands came out of his pockets as if lifted by a spring <\s>
<s> he saw her flush start forward <\s>
<s> he had done the right thing her face was shining with wistful admiration <\s>
<s> jolly stood up and made a little bow as who should say you've passed <\s>
<s> to morrow then he said we'll go together <\s>
<s> recovering from the impetus which had carried him to that decision val looked at him maliciously from under his lashes <\s>
<s> all right he thought one to you <\s>
<s> i shall have to join but i'll get back on you somehow <\s>
<s> and he said with dignity i shall be ready <\s>
<s> we'll meet at the main recruiting office then said jolly at twelve o'clock <\s>
<s> and opening the window he went out on to the terrace conforming to the creed which had made him retire when he surprised them in the hall <\s>
<s> the confusion in the mind of val thus left alone with her for whom he had paid this sudden price was extreme <\s>
<s> the mood of showing off was still however uppermost <\s>
<s> one must do the wretched thing with an air <\s>
<s> we shall get plenty of riding and shooting anyway he said that's one comfort <\s>
<s> and it gave him a sort of grim pleasure to hear the sigh which seemed to come from the bottom of her heart <\s>
<s> the war'll soon be over he said perhaps we shan't even have to go out <\s>
<s> i don't care except for you <\s>
<s> he would be out of the way of that beastly divorce <\s>
<s> it was an ill wind <\s>
<s> he felt her warm hand slip into his <\s>
<s> jolly thought he had stopped their loving each other did he <\s>
<s> he held her tightly round the waist looking at her softly through his lashes smiling to cheer her up promising to come down and see her soon feeling somehow six inches taller and much more in command of her than he had ever dared feel before <\s>
<s> many times he kissed her before he mounted and rode back to town <\s>
<s> so swiftly on the least provocation does the possessive instinct flourish and grow <\s>
<s> chapter ix dinner at james dinner parties were not now given at james in park lane to every house the moment comes when master or mistress is no longer up to it no more can nine courses be served to twenty mouths above twenty fine white expanses nor does the household cat any longer wonder why she is suddenly shut up <\s>
<s> so with something like excitement emily who at seventy would still have liked a little feast and fashion now and then ordered dinner for six instead of two herself wrote a number of foreign words on cards and arranged the flowers mimosa from the riviera and white roman hyacinths not from rome <\s>
<s> there would only be of course james and herself soames winifred val and imogen but she liked to pretend a little and dally in imagination with the glory of the past <\s>
<s> she so dressed herself that james remarked what are you putting on that thing for <\s>
<s> but emily knew that the necks of women are protected by love of shining unto fourscore years and she only answered let me put you on one of those dickies i got you james then you'll only have to change your trousers and put on your velvet coat and there you'll be <\s>
<s> val likes you to look nice <\s>
<s> you're always wasting your money on something <\s>
<s> but he suffered the change to be made till his neck also shone murmuring vaguely he's an extravagant chap i'm afraid <\s>
<s> a little brighter in the eye with rather more colour than usual in his cheeks he took his seat in the drawing room to wait for the sound of the front door bell <\s>
<s> i've made it a proper dinner party emily said comfortably i thought it would be good practice for imogen she must get used to it now she's coming out <\s>
<s> james uttered an indeterminate sound thinking of imogen as she used to climb about his knee or pull christmas crackers with him <\s>
<s> she'll be pretty he muttered i shouldn't wonder <\s>
<s> she is pretty said emily she ought to make a good match <\s>
<s> there you go murmured james she'd much better stay at home and look after her mother <\s>
<s> a second dartie carrying off his pretty granddaughter would finish him <\s>
<s> he had never quite forgiven emily for having been as much taken in by montague dartie as he himself had been <\s>
<s> i should like a glass of madeira to night <\s>
<s> james shook his head <\s>
<s> no body he said i can't get any good out of it <\s>
<s> emily reached forward on her side of the fire and rang the bell <\s>
<s> your master would like a bottle of madeira opened warmson <\s>
<s> said james the tips of his ears quivering with vehemence and his eyes fixed on an object seen by him alone <\s>
<s> look here warmson you go to the inner cellar and on the middle shelf of the end bin on the left you'll see seven bottles take the one in the centre and don't shake it <\s>
<s> it's the last of the madeira i had from mr <\s>
<s> jolyon when we came in here never been moved it ought to be in prime condition still but i don't know i can't tell <\s>
<s> very good sir responded the withdrawing warmson <\s>
<s> i was keeping it for our golden wedding said james suddenly but i shan't live three years at my age <\s>
<s> nonsense james said emily don't talk like that <\s>
<s> i ought to have got it up myself murmured james he'll shake it as likely as not <\s>
<s> and he sank into silent recollection of long moments among the open gas jets the cobwebs and the good smell of wine soaked corks which had been appetiser to so many feasts <\s>
<s> in the wine from that cellar was written the history of the forty odd years since he had come to the park lane house with his young bride and of the many generations of friends and acquaintances who had passed into the unknown its depleted bins preserved the record of family festivity all the marriages births deaths of his kith and kin <\s>
<s> and when he was gone there it would be and he didn't know what would become of it <\s>
<s> it'd be drunk or spoiled he shouldn't wonder <\s>
<s> from that deep reverie the entrance of his son dragged him followed very soon by that of winifred and her two eldest <\s>
<s> they went down arm in arm james with imogen the debutante because his pretty grandchild cheered him soames with winifred emily with val whose eyes lighting on the oysters brightened <\s>
<s> this was to be a proper full blowout with fizz and port <\s>
<s> and he felt in need of it after what he had done that day as yet undivulged <\s>
<s> after the first glass or two it became pleasant to have this bombshell up his sleeve this piece of sensational patriotism or example rather of personal daring to display for his pleasure in what he had done for his queen and country was so far entirely personal <\s>
<s> he was now a blood indissolubly connected with guns and horses he had a right to swagger not of course that he was going to <\s>
<s> he should just announce it quietly when there was a pause <\s>
<s> and glancing down the menu he determined on bombe aux fraises as the proper moment there would be a certain solemnity while they were eating that <\s>
<s> once or twice before they reached that rosy summit of the dinner he was attacked by remembrance that his grandfather was never told anything <\s>
<s> still the old boy was drinking madeira and looking jolly fit <\s>
<s> besides he ought to be pleased at this set off to the disgrace of the divorce <\s>
<s> the sight of his uncle opposite too was a sharp incentive <\s>
<s> he was so far from being a sportsman that it would be worth a lot to see his face <\s>
<s> besides better to tell his mother in this way than privately which might upset them both <\s>
<s> he was sorry for her but after all one couldn't be expected to feel much for others when one had to part from holly <\s>
