<s> this went on and on and he never got through till he woke with the word irene on his lips <\s>
<s> the dream disturbed him badly especially that identification of himself with soames <\s>
<s> next morning finding it impossible to work he spent hours riding jolly's horse in search of fatigue <\s>
<s> and on the second day he made up his mind to move to london and see if he could not get permission to follow his daughters to south africa <\s>
<s> he had just begun to pack the following morning when he received this letter green hotel june 13 <\s>
<s> my dear jolyon you will be surprised to see how near i am to you <\s>
<s> paris became impossible and i have come here to be within reach of your advice <\s>
<s> i would so love to see you again <\s>
<s> since you left paris i don't think i have met anyone i could really talk to <\s>
<s> is all well with you and with your boy <\s>
<s> no one knows i think that i am here at present <\s>
<s> always your friend irene <\s>
<s> irene within three miles of him and again in flight <\s>
<s> he stood with a very queer smile on his lips <\s>
<s> this was more than he had bargained for <\s>
<s> about noon he set out on foot across richmond park and as he went along he thought richmond park <\s>
<s> by jove it suits us forsytes <\s>
<s> not that forsytes lived there nobody lived there save royalty rangers and the deer but in richmond park nature was allowed to go so far and no further putting up a brave show of being natural seeming to say look at my instincts they are almost passions very nearly out of hand but not quite of course the very hub of possession is to possess oneself <\s>
<s> richmond park possessed itself even on that bright day of june with arrowy cuckoos shifting the tree points of their calls and the wood doves announcing high summer <\s>
<s> the green hotel which jolyon entered at one o'clock stood nearly opposite that more famous hostelry the crown and sceptre it was modest highly respectable never out of cold beef gooseberry tart and a dowager or two so that a carriage and pair was almost always standing before the door <\s>
<s> in a room draped in chintz so slippery as to forbid all emotion irene was sitting on a piano stool covered with crewel work playing hansel and gretel out of an old score <\s>
<s> above her on a wall not yet morris papered was a print of the queen on a pony amongst deer hounds scotch caps and slain stags beside her in a pot on the window sill was a white and rosy fuchsia <\s>
<s> the victorianism of the room almost talked and in her clinging frock irene seemed to jolyon like venus emerging from the shell of the past century <\s>
<s> if the proprietor had eyes he said he would show you the door you have broken through his decorations <\s>
<s> thus lightly he smothered up an emotional moment <\s>
<s> having eaten cold beef pickled walnut gooseberry tart and drunk stone bottle ginger beer they walked into the park and light talk was succeeded by the silence jolyon had dreaded <\s>
<s> you haven't told me about paris he said at last <\s>
<s> i've been shadowed for a long time one gets used to that <\s>
<s> but then soames came <\s>
<s> by the little niobe the same story would i go back to him <\s>
<s> she had spoken without raising her eyes but she looked up now <\s>
<s> those dark eyes clinging to his said as no words could have i have come to an end if you want me here i am <\s>
<s> for sheer emotional intensity had he ever old as he was passed through such a moment <\s>
<s> the words irene i adore you <\s>
<s> then with a clearness of which he would not have believed mental vision capable he saw jolly lying with a white face turned to a white wall <\s>
<s> my boy is very ill out there he said quietly <\s>
<s> irene slipped her arm through his <\s>
<s> let's walk on i understand <\s>
<s> no miserable explanation to attempt <\s>
<s> and they walked on among the bracken knee high already between the rabbit holes and the oak trees talking of jolly <\s>
<s> he left her two hours later at the richmond hill gate and turned towards home <\s>
<s> she knows of my feeling for her then he thought <\s>
<s> one could not keep knowledge of that from such a woman <\s>
<s> chapter iv over the river jolly was tired to death of dreams <\s>
<s> they had left him now too wan and weak to dream again left him to lie torpid faintly remembering far off things just able to turn his eyes and gaze through the window near his cot at the trickle of river running by in the sands at the straggling milk bush of the karoo beyond <\s>
<s> he knew what the karoo was now even if he had not seen a boer roll over like a rabbit or heard the whine of flying bullets <\s>
<s> this pestilence had sneaked on him before he had smelled powder <\s>
<s> a thirsty day and a rash drink or perhaps a tainted fruit who knew <\s>
<s> not he who had not even strength left to grudge the evil thing its victory just enough to know that there were many lying here with him that he was sore with frenzied dreaming just enough to watch that thread of river and be able to remember faintly those far away things .... <\s>
<s> the sun was nearly down <\s>
<s> it would be cooler soon <\s>
<s> he would have liked to know the time to feel his old watch so butter smooth to hear the repeater strike <\s>
<s> it would have been friendly home like <\s>
<s> he had not even strength to remember that the old watch was last wound the day he began to lie here <\s>
<s> the pulse of his brain beat so feebly that faces which came and went nurse's doctor's orderly's were indistinguishable just one indifferent face and the words spoken about him meant all the same thing and that almost nothing <\s>
