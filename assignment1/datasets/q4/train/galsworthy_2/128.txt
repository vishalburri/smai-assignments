<s> soames took his leave <\s>
<s> all the way down to reading he debated whether he should tell fleur of that boy's father's death <\s>
<s> it did not alter the situation except that he would be independent now and only have his mother's opposition to encounter <\s>
<s> he would come into a lot of money no doubt and perhaps the house the house built for irene and himself the house whose architect had wrought his domestic ruin <\s>
<s> his daughter mistress of that house <\s>
<s> that would be poetic justice <\s>
<s> soames uttered a little mirthless laugh <\s>
<s> he had designed that house to re establish his failing union meant it for the seat of his descendants if he could have induced irene to give him one <\s>
<s> her son and fleur <\s>
<s> their children would be in some sort offspring of the union between himself and her <\s>
<s> the theatricality in that thought was repulsive to his sober sense <\s>
<s> and yet it would be the easiest and wealthiest way out of the impasse now that jolyon was gone <\s>
<s> the juncture of two forsyte fortunes had a kind of conservative charm <\s>
<s> and she irene would be linked to him once more <\s>
<s> he put the notion from his head <\s>
<s> on arriving home he heard the click of billiard balls and through the window saw young mont sprawling over the table <\s>
<s> fleur with her cue akimbo was watching with a smile <\s>
<s> how pretty she looked <\s>
<s> no wonder that young fellow was out of his mind about her <\s>
<s> there was little enough in land these days perhaps less in a title <\s>
<s> the old forsytes had always had a kind of contempt for titles rather remote and artificial things not worth the money they cost and having to do with the court <\s>
<s> they had all had that feeling in differing measure soames remembered <\s>
<s> swithin indeed in his most expansive days had once attended a levee <\s>
<s> he had come away saying he shouldn't go again all that small fry <\s>
<s> it was suspected that he had looked too big in knee breeches <\s>
<s> soames remembered how his own mother had wished to be presented because of the fashionable nature of the performance and how his father had put his foot down with unwonted decision <\s>
<s> what did she want with that peacocking wasting time and money there was nothing in it <\s>
<s> the instinct which had made and kept the english commons the chief power in the state a feeling that their own world was good enough and a little better than any other because it was their world had kept the old forsytes singularly free of flummery as nicholas had been wont to call it when he had the gout <\s>
<s> soames generation more self conscious and ironical had been saved by a sense of swithin in knee breeches <\s>
<s> while the third and the fourth generation as it seemed to him laughed at everything <\s>
<s> however there was no harm in the young fellow's being heir to a title and estate a thing one couldn't help <\s>
