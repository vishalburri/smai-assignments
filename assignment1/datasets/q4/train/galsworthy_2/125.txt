<s> your mother fled from his house that night for twelve years she lived quietly alone without companionship of any sort until in 1899 her husband you see he was still her husband for he did not attempt to divorce her and she of course had no right to divorce him became conscious it seems of the want of children and commenced a long attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a child <\s>
<s> i was her trustee then under your grandfather's will and i watched this going on <\s>

<s> that decided us and we became united in fact <\s>
<s> she was divorced married me and you were born <\s>
<s> we have lived in perfect happiness at least i have and i believe your mother also <\s>
<s> soames soon after the divorce married fleur's mother and she was born <\s>
<s> that is the story jon <\s>
<s> i have told it you because by the affection which we see you have formed for this man's daughter you are blindly moving toward what must utterly destroy your mother's happiness if not your own <\s>
<s> i don't wish to speak of myself because at my age there's no use supposing i shall cumber the ground much longer besides what i should suffer would be mainly on her account and on yours <\s>
<s> but what i want you to realise is that feelings of horror and aversion such as those can never be buried or forgotten <\s>
<s> they are alive in her to day <\s>
<s> only yesterday at lord's we happened to see soames forsyte <\s>
<s> her face if you had seen it would have convinced you <\s>
<s> the idea that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her jon <\s>
<s> i have nothing to say against fleur save that she is his daughter <\s>
<s> but your children if you married her would be the grandchildren of soames as much as of your mother of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave <\s>
<s> think what that would mean <\s>
<s> by such a marriage you enter the camp which held your mother prisoner and wherein she ate her heart out <\s>
<s> you are just on the threshold of life you have only known this girl two months and however deeply you think you love her i appeal to you to break it off at once <\s>
<s> don't give your mother this rankling pain and humiliation during the rest of her life <\s>

<s> i don't wish to write harshly of soames forsyte <\s>

<s> it's not his fault so was he born <\s>
<s> to me it is a view that has always been abhorrent so was i born <\s>
<s> knowing you as i do i feel it cannot be otherwise than abhorrent to you <\s>
<s> let me go on with the story <\s>
<s> your mother fled from his house that night for twelve years she lived quietly alone without companionship of any sort until in 1899 her husband you see he was still her husband for he did not attempt to divorce her and she of course had no right to divorce him became conscious it seems of the want of children and commenced a long attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a child <\s>
<s> i was her trustee then under your grandfather's will and i watched this going on <\s>
<s> while watching i became attached to her devotedly attached <\s>
<s> his pressure increased till one day she came to me here and practically put herself under my protection <\s>
<s> her husband who was kept informed of all her movements attempted to force us apart by bringing a divorce suit or possibly he really meant it i don't know but anyway our names were publicly joined <\s>
<s> that decided us and we became united in fact <\s>
<s> she was divorced married me and you were born <\s>
<s> we have lived in perfect happiness at least i have and i believe your mother also <\s>
<s> soames soon after the divorce married fleur's mother and she was born <\s>
<s> that is the story jon <\s>
<s> i have told it you because by the affection which we see you have formed for this man's daughter you are blindly moving toward what must utterly destroy your mother's happiness if not your own <\s>
<s> i don't wish to speak of myself because at my age there's no use supposing i shall cumber the ground much longer besides what i should suffer would be mainly on her account and on yours <\s>
<s> but what i want you to realise is that feelings of horror and aversion such as those can never be buried or forgotten <\s>
<s> they are alive in her to day <\s>
<s> only yesterday at lord's we happened to see soames forsyte <\s>
<s> her face if you had seen it would have convinced you <\s>
<s> the idea that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her jon <\s>
<s> i have nothing to say against fleur save that she is his daughter <\s>
<s> but your children if you married her would be the grandchildren of soames as much as of your mother of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave <\s>
<s> think what that would mean <\s>
<s> by such a marriage you enter the camp which held your mother prisoner and wherein she ate her heart out <\s>
<s> you are just on the threshold of life you have only known this girl two months and however deeply you think you love her i appeal to you to break it off at once <\s>
<s> don't give your mother this rankling pain and humiliation during the rest of her life <\s>
<s> young though she will always seem to me she is fifty seven <\s>
<s> except for us two she has no one in the world <\s>
<s> she will soon have only you <\s>
<s> pluck up your spirit jon and break away <\s>
<s> don't put this cloud and barrier between you <\s>
<s> don't break her heart <\s>
<s> bless you my dear boy and again forgive me for all the pain this letter must bring you we tried to spare it you but spain it seems  was no good <\s>

<s> having finished his confession jolyon sat with a thin cheek on his hand re reading <\s>
<s> there were things in it which hurt him so much when he thought of jon reading them that he nearly tore the letter up <\s>
<s> to speak of such things at all to a boy his own boy to speak of them in relation to his own wife and the boy's own mother seemed dreadful to the reticence of his forsyte soul <\s>
<s> and yet without speaking of them how make jon understand the reality the deep cleavage the ineffaceable scar <\s>
<s> without them how justify this stiffing of the boy's love <\s>
<s> he might just as well not write at all <\s>
<s> he folded the confession and put it in his pocket <\s>
<s> it was thank heaven saturday he had till sunday evening to think it over for even if posted now it could not reach jon till monday <\s>

<s> many very many years ago as far back indeed as 1883 when she was only twenty your mother had the great and lasting misfortune to make an unhappy marriage no not with me jon <\s>
<s> without money of her own and with only a stepmother closely related to jezebel she was very unhappy in her home life <\s>
<s> it was fleur's father that she married my cousin soames forsyte <\s>

<s> within a week she knew the fearful mistake she had made <\s>
<s> it was not his fault it was her error of judgment her misfortune <\s>
<s> so far jolyon had kept some semblance of irony but now his subject carried him away <\s>
<s> jon i want to explain to you if i can and it's very hard how it is that an unhappy marriage such as this can so easily come about <\s>
<s> you will of course say if she didn't really love him how could she ever have married him <\s>
<s> you would be right if it were not for one or two rather terrible considerations <\s>
<s> from this initial mistake of hers all the subsequent trouble sorrow and tragedy have come and so i must make it clear to you if i can <\s>
<s> you see jon in those days and even to this day indeed i don't see for all the talk of enlightenment how it can well be otherwise most girls are married ignorant of the sexual side of life <\s>
<s> even if they know what it means they have not experienced it <\s>
<s> it is this actual lack of experience whatever verbal knowledge they have which makes all the difference and all the trouble <\s>
<s> in a vast number of marriages and your mother's was one girls are not and cannot be certain whether they love the man they marry or not they do not know until after that act of union which makes the reality of marriage <\s>
<s> now in many perhaps in most doubtful cases this act cements and strengthens the attachment but in other cases and your mother's was one it is a revelation of mistake a destruction of such attraction as there was <\s>

<s> after three years of effort to subdue her shrinking i was going to say her loathing and it's not too strong a word for shrinking soon becomes loathing under such circumstances three years of what to a sensitive beauty loving nature like your mother's jon was torment she met a young man who fell in love with her <\s>

<s> i have long been sorry for him perhaps i was sorry even then <\s>
<s> as the world judges she was in error he within his rights <\s>
<s> he loved her in his way <\s>
<s> she was his property <\s>
<s> that is the view he holds of life of human feelings and hearts property <\s>
<s> it's not his fault so was he born <\s>
<s> to me it is a view that has always been abhorrent so was i born <\s>
<s> knowing you as i do i feel it cannot be otherwise than abhorrent to you <\s>
<s> let me go on with the story <\s>
<s> your mother fled from his house that night for twelve years she lived quietly alone without companionship of any sort until in 1899 her husband you see he was still her husband for he did not attempt to divorce her and she of course had no right to divorce him became conscious it seems of the want of children and commenced a long attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a child <\s>
<s> i was her trustee then under your grandfather's will and i watched this going on <\s>
<s> while watching i became attached to her devotedly attached <\s>
<s> his pressure increased till one day she came to me here and practically put herself under my protection <\s>
<s> her husband who was kept informed of all her movements attempted to force us apart by bringing a divorce suit or possibly he really meant it i don't know but anyway our names were publicly joined <\s>
<s> that decided us and we became united in fact <\s>
<s> she was divorced married me and you were born <\s>
<s> we have lived in perfect happiness at least i have and i believe your mother also <\s>
<s> soames soon after the divorce married fleur's mother and she was born <\s>
<s> that is the story jon <\s>
<s> i have told it you because by the affection which we see you have formed for this man's daughter you are blindly moving toward what must utterly destroy your mother's happiness if not your own <\s>
<s> i don't wish to speak of myself because at my age there's no use supposing i shall cumber the ground much longer besides what i should suffer would be mainly on her account and on yours <\s>
<s> but what i want you to realise is that feelings of horror and aversion such as those can never be buried or forgotten <\s>
<s> they are alive in her to day <\s>
<s> only yesterday at lord's we happened to see soames forsyte <\s>
<s> her face if you had seen it would have convinced you <\s>
<s> the idea that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her jon <\s>
<s> i have nothing to say against fleur save that she is his daughter <\s>
<s> but your children if you married her would be the grandchildren of soames as much as of your mother of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave <\s>
<s> think what that would mean <\s>
<s> by such a marriage you enter the camp which held your mother prisoner and wherein she ate her heart out <\s>
<s> you are just on the threshold of life you have only known this girl two months and however deeply you think you love her i appeal to you to break it off at once <\s>
<s> don't give your mother this rankling pain and humiliation during the rest of her life <\s>
<s> young though she will always seem to me she is fifty seven <\s>
<s> except for us two she has no one in the world <\s>
<s> she will soon have only you <\s>
<s> pluck up your spirit jon and break away <\s>
<s> don't put this cloud and barrier between you <\s>
<s> don't break her heart <\s>
<s> bless you my dear boy and again forgive me for all the pain this letter must bring you we tried to spare it you but spain it seems  was no good <\s>
<s> ever your devoted father jolyon forsyte <\s>
<s> having finished his confession jolyon sat with a thin cheek on his hand re reading <\s>
<s> there were things in it which hurt him so much when he thought of jon reading them that he nearly tore the letter up <\s>
<s> to speak of such things at all to a boy his own boy to speak of them in relation to his own wife and the boy's own mother seemed dreadful to the reticence of his forsyte soul <\s>
<s> and yet without speaking of them how make jon understand the reality the deep cleavage the ineffaceable scar <\s>
<s> without them how justify this stiffing of the boy's love <\s>
<s> he might just as well not write at all <\s>
<s> he folded the confession and put it in his pocket <\s>
<s> it was thank heaven saturday he had till sunday evening to think it over for even if posted now it could not reach jon till monday <\s>
<s> he felt a curious relief at this delay and at the fact that whether sent or not it was written <\s>
