<s> the juno the handkerchief fleur's eyes her questions and now this delay in her return the symptoms seemed to him so sinister that faithful to his nature he could not part with them <\s>
<s> i think you take too much care said winifred <\s>
<s> if i were you i should tell her of that old matter <\s>
<s> it's no good thinking that girls in these days are as they used to be <\s>
<s> where they pick up their knowledge i can't tell but they seem to know everything <\s>
<s> over soames face closely composed passed a sort of spasm and winifred added hastily if you don't like to speak of it i could for you <\s>
<s> soames shook his head <\s>
<s> unless there was absolute necessity the thought that his adored daughter should learn of that old scandal hurt his pride too much <\s>
<s> no he said not yet <\s>
<s> never if i can help it <\s>
<s> think what people are <\s>
<s> twenty years is a long time muttered soames <\s>
<s> outside our family who's likely to remember <\s>
<s> she inclined more and more to that peace and quietness of which montague dartie had deprived her in her youth <\s>
<s> jon agreed that it would be a good remedy <\s>
<s> it's their sense of property he said which makes people chain things <\s>
<s> the last generation thought of nothing but property and that's why there was the war <\s>
<s> said fleur i never thought of that <\s>
<s> your people and mine quarrelled about property <\s>
<s> and anyway we've all got it at least i suppose your people have <\s>
<s> yes luckily i don't suppose i shall be any good at making money <\s>
<s> if you were i don't believe i should like you <\s>
<s> jon slipped his hand tremulously under her arm <\s>
<s> fleur looked straight before her and chanted jon jon the farmer's son stole a pig and away he run <\s>
<s> jon's arm crept round her waist <\s>
<s> this is rather sudden said fleur calmly do you often do it <\s>
<s> jon dropped his arm <\s>
<s> but when she laughed his arm stole back again and fleur began to sing o who will oer the downs so free o who will with me ride <\s>
<s> o who will up and follow me sing jon <\s>
<s> the larks joined in sheep bells and an early morning church far away over in steyning <\s>
<s> they went on from tune to tune till fleur said my god <\s>
<s> i am hungry now <\s>
<s> she looked round into his face <\s>
<s> jon you're rather a darling <\s>
<s> and she pressed his hand against her waist <\s>
<s> jon almost reeled from happiness <\s>
<s> a yellow and white dog coursing a hare startled them apart <\s>
<s> they watched the two vanish down the slope till fleur said with a sigh he'll never catch it thank goodness <\s>
<s> i never wound it <\s>
<s> jon looked at his watch <\s>
<s> he said mine's stopped too <\s>
<s> they walked on again but only hand in hand <\s>
<s> if the grass is dry said fleur let's sit down for half a minute <\s>
<s> jon took off his coat and they shared it <\s>
<s> with his arm round her waist again they sat some minutes in silence <\s>
<s> cried fleur jumping up we shall be most fearfully late and look so silly and put them on their guard <\s>
<s> look here jon we only came out to get an appetite for breakfast and lost our way <\s>
<s> it's serious there'll be a stopper put on us <\s>
<s> are you a good liar <\s>
<s> i believe not very but i can try <\s>
<s> you know she said i realize that they don't mean us to be friends <\s>
<s> i told you why <\s>
<s> yes but you don't know my father <\s>
<s> i suppose he's fearfully fond of you <\s>
<s> you see i'm an only child <\s>
<s> and so are you of your mother <\s>
<s> isn't it a bore <\s>
<s> there's so much expected of one <\s>
<s> by the time they've done expecting one's as good as dead <\s>
<s> yes muttered jon life's beastly short <\s>
<s> one wants to live forever and know everything <\s>
<s> no cried jon i only want to love once you <\s>
<s> there's the chalk pit we can't be very far now <\s>
<s> jon followed wondering fearfully if he had offended her <\s>
<s> the chalk pit was full of sunshine and the murmuration of bees <\s>
<s> fleur flung back her hair <\s>
<s> well she said in case of accidents you may give me one kiss jon and she pushed her cheek forward <\s>
<s> with ecstasy he kissed that hot soft cheek <\s>
<s> we lost our way and leave it to me as much as you can <\s>
<s> i'm going to be rather beastly to you it's safer try and be beastly to me <\s>
<s> jon shook his head <\s>
<s> just to please me till five o'clock at all events <\s>
<s> anybody will be able to see through it said jon gloomily <\s>
<s> well do your best <\s>
<s> you haven't got one <\s>
<s> get a little away from me and look sulky <\s>
<s> five minutes later entering the house and doing his utmost to look sulky jon heard her clear voice in the dining room oh <\s>
<s> he's going to be a farmer and he loses his way <\s>
<s> the boy's an idiot <\s>
<s> goya lunch was over and soames mounted to the picture gallery in his house near mapleduram <\s>
<s> he had what annette called a grief <\s>
<s> fleur was not yet home <\s>
<s> she had been expected on wednesday had wired that it would be friday and again on friday that it would be sunday afternoon and here were her aunt and her cousins the cardigans and this fellow profond and everything flat as a pancake for the want of her <\s>
<s> he stood before his gauguin sorest point of his collection <\s>
<s> he had bought the ugly great thing with two early matisses before the war because there was such a fuss about those post impressionist chaps <\s>
<s> he was wondering whether profond would take them off his hands the fellow seemed not to know what to do with his money when he heard his sister's voice say i think that's a horrid thing soames and saw that winifred had followed him up <\s>
<s> he said dryly i gave five hundred for it <\s>
<s> women aren't made like that even if they are black <\s>
<s> soames uttered a glum laugh <\s>
<s> you didn't come up to tell me that <\s>
<s> do you know that jolyon's boy is staying with val and his wife <\s>
<s> yes drawled winifred he's gone to live with them there while he learns farming <\s>
<s> soames had turned away but her voice pursued him as he walked up and down <\s>
<s> i warned val that neither of them was to be spoken to about old matters <\s>
<s> why didn't you tell me before <\s>
<s> winifred shrugged her substantial shoulders <\s>
<s> fleur does what she likes <\s>
<s> you've always spoiled her <\s>
<s> besides my dear boy what's the harm <\s>
<s> why she he checked himself <\s>
<s> the juno the handkerchief fleur's eyes her questions and now this delay in her return the symptoms seemed to him so sinister that faithful to his nature he could not part with them <\s>
