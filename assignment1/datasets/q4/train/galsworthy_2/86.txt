<s> can't you do anything to ease his breathing <\s>
<s> only an injection and he can't stand it <\s>
<s> the doctor said while he was fighting .... <\s>
<s> he's not fighting whispered soames he's being slowly smothered <\s>
<s> james stirred uneasily as if he knew what they were saying <\s>
<s> soames rose and bent over him <\s>
<s> james feebly moved his two hands and soames took them <\s>
<s> he wants to be pulled up whispered the nurse <\s>
<s> he thought he pulled gently but a look almost of anger passed over james face <\s>
<s> the nurse plumped the pillows <\s>
<s> soames laid the hands down and bending over kissed his father's forehead <\s>
<s> as he was raising himself again james eyes bent on him a look which seemed to come from the very depths of what was left within <\s>
<s> i'm done my boy it seemed to say take care of them take care of yourself take care i leave it all to you <\s>
<s> yes yes soames whispered yes yes <\s>
<s> behind him the nurse did he knew not what for his father made a tiny movement of repulsion as if resenting that interference and almost at once his breathing eased away became quiet he lay very still <\s>
<s> the strained expression on his face passed a curious white tranquillity took its place <\s>
<s> his eyelids quivered rested the whole face rested at ease <\s>
<s> only by the faint puffing of his lips could they tell that he was breathing <\s>
<s> soames sank back on his chair and fell to cherishing the foot again <\s>

<s> but soames bent sideways over the feet warming them both they gave him comfort colder and colder though they grew <\s>
<s> suddenly he started up a sound a dreadful sound such as he had never heard was coming from his father's lips as if an outraged heart had broken with a long moan <\s>
<s> what a strong heart to have uttered that farewell <\s>
<s> soames looked into the face <\s>
<s> no motion no breath <\s>
<s> he kissed the brow turned round and went out of the room <\s>
<s> he ran upstairs to the bedroom his old bedroom still kept for him flung himself face down on the bed and broke into sobs which he stilled with the pillow .... <\s>
<s> a little later he went downstairs and passed into the room <\s>
<s> james lay alone wonderfully calm free from shadow and anxiety with the gravity on his ravaged face which underlies great age the worn fine gravity of old coins <\s>
<s> soames looked steadily at that face at the fire at all the room with windows thrown open to the london night <\s>
<s> he whispered and went out <\s>
<s> chapter xiv his he had much to see to that night and all next day <\s>
