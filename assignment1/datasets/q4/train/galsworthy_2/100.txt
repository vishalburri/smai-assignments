<s> what his wife saw in the fellow he didn't know unless it was that he could speak her language and there passed in soames what monsieur profond would have called a small doubt whether annette was not too handsome to be walking with any one so cosmopolitan <\s>
<s> even at that distance he could see the blue fumes from profond's cigar wreath out in the quiet sunlight and his grey buckskin shoes and his grey hat the fellow was a dandy <\s>
<s> and he could see the quick turn of his wife's head so very straight on her desirable neck and shoulders <\s>
<s> that turn of her neck always seemed to him a little too showy and in the queen of all i survey manner not quite distinguished <\s>
<s> he watched them walk along the path at the bottom of the garden <\s>
<s> a young man in flannels joined them down there a sunday caller no doubt from up the river <\s>
<s> he went back to his goya <\s>
<s> he was still staring at that replica of fleur and worrying over winifred's news when his wife's voice said mr <\s>
<s> you invited him to see your pictures <\s>
<s> there was the cheerful young man of the gallery off cork street <\s>
<s> turned up you see sir i live only four miles from pangbourne <\s>
<s> jolly day isn't it <\s>
<s> confronted with the results of his expansiveness soames scrutinized his visitor <\s>
<s> the young man's mouth was excessively large and curly he seemed always grinning <\s>

<s> what on earth were young men about deliberately lowering their class with these tooth brushes or little slug whiskers <\s>
<s> in other respects he was presentable and his flannels very clean <\s>
<s> happy to see you <\s>
<s> the young man who had been turning his head from side to side became transfixed <\s>
<s> he said some picture <\s>
<s> soames saw with mixed sensations that he had addressed the remark to the goya copy <\s>
<s> yes he said dryly that's not a goya <\s>
<s> i had it painted because it reminded me of my daughter <\s>
<s> i thought i knew the face sir <\s>
<s> the frankness of his interest almost disarmed soames <\s>
<s> she'll be in after tea he said <\s>
<s> shall we go round the pictures <\s>
<s> and soames began that round which never tired him <\s>
<s> he had not anticipated much intelligence from one who had mistaken a copy for an original but as they passed from section to section period to period he was startled by the young man's frank and relevant remarks <\s>
<s> and since pictures always depressed her she soon went down again <\s>
<s> soames passed into the corner where side by side hung his real goya and the copy of the fresco la vendimia <\s>
<s> his acquisition of the real goya rather beautifully illustrated the cobweb of vested interests and passions which mesh the bright winged fly of human life <\s>
<s> the real goya's noble owner's ancestor had come into possession of it during some spanish war it was in a word loot <\s>
<s> the noble owner had remained in ignorance of its value until in the nineties an enterprising critic discovered that a spanish painter named goya was a genius <\s>
<s> it was only a fair goya but almost unique in england and the noble owner became a marked man <\s>
<s> having many possessions and that aristocratic culture which independent of mere sensuous enjoyment is founded on the sounder principle that one must know everything and be fearfully interested in life he had fully intended to keep an article which contributed to his reputation while he was alive and to leave it to the nation after he was dead <\s>
<s> fortunately for soames the house of lords was violently attacked in 1909 and the noble owner became alarmed and angry <\s>
<s> if he said to himself they think they can have it both ways they are very much mistaken <\s>
<s> so long as they leave me in quiet enjoyment the nation can have some of my pictures at my death <\s>
<s> but if the nation is going to bait me and rob me like this i'm damned if i won't sell the lot <\s>
<s> they can't have my private property and my public spirit both <\s>
<s> he brooded in this fashion for several months till one morning after reading the speech of a certain statesman he telegraphed to his agent to come down and bring bodkin <\s>
<s> on going over the collection bodkin than whose opinion on market values none was more sought pronounced that with a free hand to sell to america germany and other places where there was an interest in art a lot more money could be made than by selling in england <\s>
<s> the noble owner's public spirit he said was well known but the pictures were unique <\s>
<s> the noble owner put this opinion in his pipe and smoked it for a year <\s>
<s> at the end of that time he read another speech by the same statesman and telegraphed to his agents give bodkin a free hand <\s>
<s> it was at this juncture that bodkin conceived the idea which saved the goya and two other unique pictures for the native country of the noble owner <\s>
<s> with one hand bodkin proffered the pictures to the foreign market with the other he formed a list of private british collectors <\s>
<s> having obtained what he considered the highest possible bids from across the seas he submitted pictures and bids to the private british collectors and invited them of their public spirit to outbid <\s>
<s> in three instances including the goya out of twenty one he was successful <\s>
<s> one of the private collectors made buttons he had made so many that he desired that his wife should be called lady buttons <\s>
<s> he therefore bought a unique picture at great cost and gave it to the nation <\s>
<s> it was part his friends said of his general game <\s>
<s> the second of the private collectors was an americophobe and bought an unique picture to spite the damned yanks <\s>
<s> the third of the private collectors was soames who more sober than either of the others bought after a visit to madrid because he was certain that goya was still on the up grade <\s>
<s> goya was not booming at the moment but he would come again and looking at that portrait hogarthian manetesque in its directness but with its own queer sharp beauty of paint he was perfectly satisfied still that he had made no error heavy though the price had been heaviest he had ever paid <\s>
<s> and next to it was hanging the copy of la vendimia <\s>
<s> there she was the little wretch looking back at him in her dreamy mood the mood he loved best because he felt so much safer when she looked like that <\s>
<s> he was still gazing when the scent of a cigar impinged on his nostrils and a voice said well mr <\s>
<s> forsyde what you goin to do with this small lot <\s>
<s> that belgian chap whose mother as if flemish blood were not enough had been armenian <\s>
<s> subduing a natural irritation he said are you a judge of pictures <\s>
<s> well i've got a few myself <\s>
<s> ye es i rather like them <\s>
<s> what do you think of this <\s>
<s> said soames pointing to the gauguin <\s>
<s> monsieur profond protruded his lower lip and short pointed beard <\s>
<s> rather fine i think he said do you want to sell it <\s>
<s> soames checked his instinctive not particularly he would not chaffer with this alien <\s>
<s> what do you want for it <\s>
<s> all right said monsieur profond <\s>
<s> i'll be glad to take that small picture <\s>
<s> post impressionists they're awful dead but they're amusin <\s>
<s> i don care for pictures much but i've got some just a small lot <\s>
<s> what do you care for <\s>
<s> monsieur profond shrugged his shoulders <\s>
<s> life's awful like a lot of monkeys scramblin for empty nuts <\s>
<s> you're young said soames <\s>
<s> if the fellow must make a generalization he needn't suggest that the forms of property lacked solidity <\s>
<s> i don worry replied monsieur profond smiling we're born and we die <\s>
<s> half the world's starvin <\s>
<s> i feed a small lot of babies out in my mother's country but what's the use <\s>
<s> might as well throw my money in the river <\s>
<s> soames looked at him and turned back toward his goya <\s>
<s> he didn't know what the fellow wanted <\s>
<s> what shall i make my cheque for <\s>
<s> five hundred said soames shortly but i don't want you to take it if you don't care for it more than that <\s>
<s> that's all right said monsieur profond i'll be appy to ave that picture <\s>
<s> he wrote a cheque with a fountain pen heavily chased with gold <\s>
<s> soames watched the process uneasily <\s>
<s> how on earth had the fellow known that he wanted to sell that picture <\s>
<s> monsieur profond held out the cheque <\s>
<s> the english are awful funny about pictures he said <\s>
<s> so are the french so are my people <\s>
<s> they're all awful funny <\s>
<s> i don't understand you said soames stiffly <\s>
<s> it's like hats said monsieur profond enigmatically small or large turnin up or down just the fashion <\s>
<s> and smiling he drifted out of the gallery again blue and solid like the smoke of his excellent cigar <\s>
<s> soames had taken the cheque feeling as if the intrinsic value of ownership had been called in question <\s>
<s> he's a cosmopolitan he thought watching profond emerge from under the verandah with annette and saunter down the lawn toward the river <\s>
