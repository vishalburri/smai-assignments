<s> don't let that dog touch your frock he said he's got wet feet <\s>
<s> but the dog balthasar went on towards the visitor who put her hand down and stroked his head <\s>
<s> old jolyon said quickly i saw you at the opera the other night you didn't notice me <\s>
<s> he felt a subtle flattery in that as though she had added do you think one could miss seeing you <\s>
<s> they're all in spain he remarked abruptly <\s>
<s> i'm alone i drove up for the opera <\s>
<s> have you seen the cow houses <\s>
<s> in a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he moved instinctively towards that bit of property and she moved beside him <\s>
<s> her figure swayed faintly like the best kind of french figures her dress too was a sort of french grey <\s>
<s> he noticed two or three silver threads in her amber coloured hair strange hair with those dark eyes of hers and that creamy pale face <\s>
<s> a sudden sidelong look from the velvety brown eyes disturbed him <\s>
<s> it seemed to come from deep and far from another world almost or at all events from some one not living very much in this <\s>
<s> and he said mechanically where are you living now <\s>
<s> i have a little flat in chelsea <\s>
<s> he did not want to hear what she was doing did not want to hear anything but the perverse word came out alone <\s>
<s> his memory went searching <\s>
<s> he had not felt his age since he had bought his nephew soames ill starred house and settled into it here at robin hill over three years ago <\s>
<s> it was as if he had been getting younger every spring living in the country with his son and his grandchildren june and the little ones of the second marriage jolly and holly living down here out of the racket of london and the cackle of forsyte change free of his boards in a delicious atmosphere of no work and all play with plenty of occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and its twenty acres and in ministering to the whims of holly and jolly <\s>
<s> all the knots and crankiness which had gathered in his heart during that long and tragic business of june soames irene his wife and poor young bosinney had been smoothed out <\s>
<s> even june had thrown off her melancholy at last witness this travel in spain she was taking now with her father and her stepmother <\s>
<s> curiously perfect peace was left by their departure blissful yet blank because his son was not there <\s>
<s> jo was never anything but a comfort and a pleasure to him nowadays an amiable chap but women somehow even the best got a little on one's nerves unless of course one admired them <\s>
<s> far off a cuckoo called a wood pigeon was cooing from the first elm tree in the field and how the daisies and buttercups had sprung up after the last mowing <\s>
<s> the wind had got into the sou west too a delicious air sappy <\s>
<s> he pushed his hat back and let the sun fall on his chin and cheek <\s>
<s> somehow to day he wanted company wanted a pretty face to look at <\s>
<s> people treated the old as if they wanted nothing <\s>
<s> and with the un forsytean philosophy which ever intruded on his soul he thought one's never had enough <\s>
<s> with a foot in the grave one'll want something i shouldn't be surprised <\s>
<s> down here away from the exigencies of affairs his grandchildren and the flowers trees birds of his little domain to say nothing of sun and moon and stars above them said open sesame to him day and night <\s>
<s> and sesame had opened how much perhaps he did not know <\s>
<s> he had always been responsive to what they had begun to call nature genuinely almost religiously responsive though he had never lost his habit of calling a sunset a sunset and a view a view however deeply they might move him <\s>
<s> but nowadays nature actually made him ache he appreciated it so <\s>
<s> every one of these calm bright lengthening days with holly's hand in his and the dog balthasar in front looking studiously for what he never found he would stroll watching the roses open fruit budding on the walls sunlight brightening the oak leaves and saplings in the coppice watching the water lily leaves unfold and glisten and the silvery young corn of the one wheat field listening to the starlings and skylarks and the alderney cows chewing the cud flicking slow their tufted tails and every one of these fine days he ached a little from sheer love of it all feeling perhaps deep down that he had not very much longer to enjoy it <\s>
<s> the thought that some day perhaps not ten years hence perhaps not five all this world would be taken away from him before he had exhausted his powers of loving it seemed to him in the nature of an injustice brooding over his horizon <\s>
<s> if anything came after this life it wouldn't be what he wanted not robin hill and flowers and birds and pretty faces too few even now of those about him <\s>
<s> with the years his dislike of humbug had increased the orthodoxy he had worn in the sixties as he had worn side whiskers out of sheer exuberance had long dropped off leaving him reverent before three things alone beauty upright conduct and the sense of property and the greatest of these now was beauty <\s>
<s> he had always had wide interests and indeed could still read the times but he was liable at any moment to put it down if he heard a blackbird sing <\s>
<s> upright conduct property somehow they were tiring the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him only gave him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them <\s>
<s> staring into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little gold and white flowers on the lawn a thought came to him this weather was like the music of orfeo which he had recently heard at covent garden <\s>
<s> a beautiful opera not like meyerbeer nor even quite mozart but in its way perhaps even more lovely something classical and of the golden age about it chaste and mellow and the ravogli almost worthy of the old days' highest praise he could bestow <\s>
<s> the yearning of orpheus for the beauty he was losing for his love going down to hades as in life love and beauty did go the yearning which sang and throbbed through the golden music stirred also in the lingering beauty of the world that evening <\s>
<s> and with the tip of his cork soled elastic sided boot he involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog balthasar causing the animal to wake and attack his fleas for though he was supposed to have none nothing could persuade him of the fact <\s>
<s> when he had finished he rubbed the place he had been scratching against his master's calf and settled down again with his chin over the instep of the disturbing boot <\s>
<s> and into old jolyon's mind came a sudden recollection a face he had seen at that opera three weeks ago irene the wife of his precious nephew soames that man of property <\s>
<s> though he had not met her since the day of the at home in his old house at stanhope gate which celebrated his granddaughter june's ill starred engagement to young bosinney he had remembered her at once for he had always admired her a very pretty creature <\s>
<s> after the death of young bosinney whose mistress she had so reprehensibly become he had heard that she had left soames at once <\s>
<s> goodness only knew what she had been doing since <\s>
<s> that sight of her face a side view in the row in front had been literally the only reminder these three years that she was still alive <\s>
<s> no one ever spoke of her <\s>
<s> and yet jo had told him something once something which had upset him completely <\s>
<s> the boy had got it from george forsyte he believed who had seen bosinney in the fog the day he was run over something which explained the young fellow's distress an act of soames towards his wife a shocking act <\s>
<s> jo had seen her too that afternoon after the news was out seen her for a moment and his description had always lingered in old jolyon's mind 'wild and lost he had called her <\s>
<s> and next day june had gone there bottled up her feelings and gone there and the maid had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped out in the night and vanished <\s>
<s> a tragic business altogether <\s>
<s> one thing was certain soames had never been able to lay hands on her again <\s>
<s> and he was living at brighton and journeying up and down a fitting fate the man of property <\s>
<s> for when he once took a dislike to anyone as he had to his nephew old jolyon never got over it <\s>
<s> he remembered still the sense of relief with which he had heard the news of irene's disappearance <\s>
<s> it had been shocking to think of her a prisoner in that house to which she must have wandered back when jo saw her wandered back for a moment like a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that news tragic death of an architect in the street <\s>
<s> her face had struck him very much the other night more beautiful than he had remembered but like a mask with something going on beneath it <\s>
<s> a young woman still twenty eight perhaps <\s>
<s> very likely she had another lover by now <\s>
<s> but at this subversive thought for married women should never love once even had been too much his instep rose and with it the dog balthasar's head <\s>
<s> the sagacious animal stood up and looked into old jolyon's face <\s>
<s> he seemed to say and old jolyon answered come on old chap <\s>
<s> slowly as was their wont they crossed among the constellations of buttercups and daisies and entered the fernery <\s>
<s> this feature where very little grew as yet had been judiciously dropped below the level of the lawn so that it might come up again on the level of the other lawn and give the impression of irregularity so important in horticulture <\s>
<s> its rocks and earth were beloved of the dog balthasar who sometimes found a mole there <\s>
<s> old jolyon made a point of passing through it because though it was not beautiful he intended that it should be some day and he would think i must get varr to come down and look at it he's better than beech <\s>
<s> for plants like houses and human complaints required the best expert consideration <\s>
<s> it was inhabited by snails and if accompanied by his grandchildren he would point to one and tell them the story of the little boy who said have plummers got leggers mother <\s>
<s> then darned if i haven't been and swallowed a snileybob <\s>
<s> and when they skipped and clutched his hand thinking of the snileybob going down the little boy's red lane his eyes would twinkle <\s>
<s> emerging from the fernery he opened the wicket gate which just there led into the first field a large and park like area out of which within brick walls the vegetable garden had been carved <\s>
<s> old jolyon avoided this which did not suit his mood and made down the hill towards the pond <\s>
<s> balthasar who knew a water rat or two gambolled in front at the gait which marks an oldish dog who takes the same walk every day <\s>
<s> arrived at the edge old jolyon stood noting another water lily opened since yesterday he would show it to holly to morrow when his little sweet had got over the upset which had followed on her eating a tomato at lunch her little arrangements were very delicate <\s>
<s> now that jolly had gone to school his first term holly was with him nearly all day long and he missed her badly <\s>
<s> he felt that pain too which often bothered him now a little dragging at his left side <\s>
<s> he looked back up the hill <\s>
<s> really poor young bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house he would have done very well for himself if he had lived <\s>
<s> and where was he now <\s>
<s> perhaps still haunting this the site of his last work of his tragic love affair <\s>
<s> or was philip bosinney's spirit diffused in the general <\s>
<s> that dog was getting his legs muddy <\s>
<s> and he moved towards the coppice <\s>
<s> there had been the most delightful lot of bluebells and he knew where some still lingered like little patches of sky fallen in between the trees away out of the sun <\s>
<s> he passed the cow houses and the hen houses there installed and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings making for one of the bluebell plots <\s>
<s> balthasar preceding him once more uttered a low growl <\s>
<s> old jolyon stirred him with his foot but the dog remained motionless just where there was no room to pass and the hair rose slowly along the centre of his woolly back <\s>
<s> whether from the growl and the look of the dog's stivered hair or from the sensation which a man feels in a wood old jolyon also felt something move along his spine <\s>
<s> and then the path turned and there was an old mossy log and on it a woman sitting <\s>
<s> her face was turned away and he had just time to think she's trespassing i must have a board put up <\s>
<s> the face he had seen at the opera the very woman he had just been thinking of <\s>
<s> in that confused moment he saw things blurred as if a spirit queer effect the slant of sunlight perhaps on her violet grey frock <\s>
<s> and then she rose and stood smiling her head a little to one side <\s>
<s> old jolyon thought how pretty she is <\s>
<s> she did not speak neither did he and he realized why with a certain admiration <\s>
<s> she was here no doubt because of some memory and did not mean to try and get out of it by vulgar explanation <\s>
<s> don't let that dog touch your frock he said he's got wet feet <\s>
<s> but the dog balthasar went on towards the visitor who put her hand down and stroked his head <\s>
<s> old jolyon said quickly i saw you at the opera the other night you didn't notice me <\s>
<s> he felt a subtle flattery in that as though she had added do you think one could miss seeing you <\s>
<s> they're all in spain he remarked abruptly <\s>
<s> i'm alone i drove up for the opera <\s>
<s> have you seen the cow houses <\s>
<s> in a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he moved instinctively towards that bit of property and she moved beside him <\s>
<s> her figure swayed faintly like the best kind of french figures her dress too was a sort of french grey <\s>
<s> he noticed two or three silver threads in her amber coloured hair strange hair with those dark eyes of hers and that creamy pale face <\s>
<s> a sudden sidelong look from the velvety brown eyes disturbed him <\s>
<s> it seemed to come from deep and far from another world almost or at all events from some one not living very much in this <\s>
<s> and he said mechanically where are you living now <\s>
<s> i have a little flat in chelsea <\s>
<s> he did not want to hear what she was doing did not want to hear anything but the perverse word came out alone <\s>
