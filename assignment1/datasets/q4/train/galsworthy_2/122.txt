<s> well i don't know i think they want their own small way and i think they always did <\s>
<s> oh but prosper winifred interjected comfortably the girls in the streets the girls who've been in munitions the little flappers in the shops their manners now really quite hit you in the eye <\s>
<s> at the word hit jack cardigan stopped his disquisition and in the silence monsieur profond said it was inside before now it's outside that's all <\s>
<s> just as moral as they ever were mrs <\s>
<s> cardigan but they've got more opportunity <\s>
<s> the saying so cryptically cynical received a little laugh from imogen a slight opening of jack cardigan's mouth and a creak from soames chair <\s>
<s> winifred said that's too bad prosper <\s>
<s> what do you say mrs <\s>
<s> forsyde don't you think human nature's always the same <\s>
<s> soames subdued a sudden longing to get up and kick the fellow <\s>
<s> he heard his wife reply human nature is not the same in england as anywhere else <\s>
<s> that was her confounded mockery <\s>
<s> well i don't know much about this small country no thank god <\s>
<s> thought soames but i should say the pot was boilin under the lid everywhere <\s>
<s> we all want pleasure and we always did <\s>
<s> his cynicism was was outrageous <\s>
<s> when lunch was over they broke up into couples for the digestive promenade <\s>
<s> too proud to notice soames knew perfectly that annette and that fellow had gone prowling round together <\s>
<s> fleur was with val she had chosen him no doubt because he knew that boy <\s>
<s> he himself had winifred for partner <\s>
<s> they walked in the bright circling stream a little flushed and sated for some minutes till winifred sighed i wish we were back forty years old boy <\s>
<s> before the eyes of her spirit an interminable procession of her own lord's frocks was passing paid for with the money of her father to save a recurrent crisis <\s>
<s> it's been very amusing after all <\s>
<s> sometimes i even wish monty was back <\s>
<s> what do you think of people nowadays soames <\s>
<s> the thing began to go to pieces with bicycles and motor cars the war has finished it <\s>
<s> i wonder what's coming <\s>
<s> said winifred in a voice dreamy from pigeon pie <\s>
<s> i'm not at all sure we shan't go back to crinolines and pegtops <\s>
<s> look at that dress <\s>
<s> soames shook his head <\s>
<s> there's money but no faith in things <\s>
<s> we don't lay by for the future <\s>
<s> these youngsters it's all a short life and a merry one with them <\s>
<s> i don't know when you come to think of the people killed and all that in the war it's rather wonderful i think <\s>
<s> there's no other country prosper says the rest are all bankrupt except america and of course her men always took their style in dress from us <\s>
<s> is that chap said soames really going to the south seas <\s>
<s> one never knows where prosper's going <\s>
<s> he's a sign of the times muttered soames if you like <\s>
<s> winifred's hand gripped his arm <\s>
<s> don't turn your head she said in a low voice but look to your right in the front row of the stand <\s>
<s> soames looked as best he could under that limitation <\s>
<s> a man in a grey top hat grey bearded with thin brown folded cheeks and a certain elegance of posture sat there with a woman in a lawn coloured frock whose dark eyes were fixed on himself <\s>
<s> soames looked quickly at his feet <\s>
<s> how funnily feet moved one after the other like that <\s>
<s> winifred's voice said in his ear jolyon looks very ill but he always had style <\s>
<s> she doesn't change except her hair <\s>
<s> why did you tell fleur about that business <\s>
<s> i didn't she picked it up <\s>
<s> i always knew she would <\s>
<s> well it's a mess <\s>
<s> she's set her heart upon their boy <\s>
<s> the little wretch murmured winifred <\s>
<s> she tried to take me in about that <\s>
<s> what shall you do soames <\s>
<s> be guided by events <\s>
<s> they moved on silent in the almost solid crowd <\s>
<s> really said winifred suddenly it almost seems like fate <\s>
<s> only that's so old fashioned <\s>
<s> there are george and eustace <\s>
<s> george forsyte's lofty bulk had halted before them <\s>
<s> just met profond and your wife <\s>
<s> you'll catch em if you put on pace <\s>
<s> did you ever go to see old timothy <\s>
<s> soames nodded and the streams forced them apart <\s>
<s> i always liked old george said winifred <\s>
<s> i never did said soames <\s>
<s> i shall go to mine <\s>
