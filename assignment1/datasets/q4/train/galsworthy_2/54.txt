<s> the kitchen garden and the pond and the coppice and the farm <\s>
<s> holly glanced back at the house <\s>
<s> it's tea time i expect there's dad beckoning <\s>
<s> val uttering a growly sound followed her towards the house <\s>
<s> when they re entered the hall gallery the sight of two middle aged forsytes drinking tea together had its magical effect and they became quite silent <\s>
<s> it was indeed an impressive spectacle <\s>
<s> the two were seated side by side on an arrangement in marqueterie which looked like three silvery pink chairs made one with a low tea table in front of them <\s>
<s> they seemed to have taken up that position as far apart as the seat would permit so that they need not look at each other too much and they were eating and drinking rather than talking soames with his air of despising the tea cake as it disappeared jolyon of finding himself slightly amusing <\s>
<s> to the casual eye neither would have seemed greedy but both were getting through a good deal of sustenance <\s>
<s> the two young ones having been supplied with food the process went on silent and absorbative till with the advent of cigarettes jolyon said to soames and how's uncle james <\s>
<s> we're a wonderful family aren't we <\s>
<s> the other day i was calculating the average age of the ten old forsytes from my father's family bible <\s>
<s> i make it eighty four already and five still living <\s>
<s> they ought to beat the record and looking whimsically at soames he added we aren't the men they were you know <\s>
<s> do you really think i shall admit that i'm not their equal he seemed to be saying or that i've got to give up anything especially life <\s>
<s> we may live to their age perhaps pursued jolyon but self consciousness is a handicap you know and that's the difference between us <\s>
<s> how and when self consciousness was born i never can make out <\s>
<s> my father had a little but i don't believe any other of the old forsytes ever had a scrap <\s>
<s> never to see yourself as others see you it's a wonderful preservative <\s>
<s> the whole history of the last century is in the difference between us <\s>
<s> and between us and you he added gazing through a ring of smoke at val and holly uncomfortable under his quizzical regard there'll be another difference <\s>
<s> soames took out his watch <\s>
<s> we must go he said if we're to catch our train <\s>
<s> uncle soames never misses a train muttered val with his mouth full <\s>
<s> i don't know grumbled val other people do <\s>
<s> at the front door he gave holly's slim brown hand a long and surreptitious squeeze <\s>
<s> look out for me to morrow he whispered three o'clock <\s>
<s> i'll wait for you in the road it'll save time <\s>
<s> we'll have a ripping ride <\s>
<s> he gazed back at her from the lodge gate and but for the principles of a man about town would have waved his hand <\s>
<s> he felt in no mood to tolerate his uncle's conversation <\s>
<s> but he was not in danger <\s>
<s> soames preserved a perfect muteness busy with far away thoughts <\s>
<s> the yellow leaves came down about those two walking the mile and a half which soames had traversed so often in those long ago days when he came down to watch with secret pride the building of the house that house which was to have been the home of him and her from whom he was now going to seek release <\s>
<s> he looked back once up that endless vista of autumn lane between the yellowing hedges <\s>
<s> what an age ago <\s>
<s> i don't want to see her he had said to jolyon <\s>
<s> i may have to he thought and he shivered seized by one of those queer shudderings that they say mean footsteps on one's grave <\s>
<s> and glancing sidelong at his nephew he thought wish i were his age <\s>
<s> i wonder what she's like now <\s>
<s> chapter viii jolyon prosecutes trusteeship when those two were gone jolyon did not return to his painting for daylight was failing but went to the study craving unconsciously a revival of that momentary vision of his father sitting in the old leather chair with his knees crossed and his straight eyes gazing up from under the dome of his massive brow <\s>
<s> often in this little room cosiest in the house jolyon would catch a moment of communion with his father <\s>
<s> not indeed that he had definitely any faith in the persistence of the human spirit the feeling was not so logical it was rather an atmospheric impact like a scent or one of those strong animistic impressions from forms or effects of light to which those with the artist's eye are especially prone <\s>
<s> here only in this little unchanged room where his father had spent the most of his waking hours could be retrieved the feeling that he was not quite gone that the steady counsel of that old spirit and the warmth of his masterful lovability endured <\s>
<s> what would his father be advising now in this sudden recrudescence of an old tragedy what would he say to this menace against her to whom he had taken such a fancy in the last weeks of his life <\s>
<s> i must do my best for her thought jolyon he left her to me in his will <\s>
<s> but what is the best <\s>
<s> and as if seeking to regain the sapience the balance and shrewd common sense of that old forsyte he sat down in the ancient chair and crossed his knees <\s>
<s> but he felt a mere shadow sitting there nor did any inspiration come while the fingers of the wind tapped on the darkening panes of the french window <\s>
<s> go and see her <\s>
<s> he thought or ask her to come down here <\s>
<s> what's her life been <\s>
<s> what is it now i wonder <\s>
<s> beastly to rake up things at this time of day <\s>
<s> again the figure of his cousin standing with a hand on a front door of a fine olive green leaped out vivid like one of those figures from old fashioned clocks when the hour strikes and his words sounded in jolyon's ears clearer than any chime i manage my own affairs <\s>
<s> i've told you once i tell you again we are not at home <\s>
<s> the repugnance he had then felt for soames for his flat cheeked shaven face full of spiritual bull doggedness for his spare square sleek figure slightly crouched as it were over the bone he could not digest came now again fresh as ever nay with an odd increase <\s>
<s> i dislike him he thought i dislike him to the very roots of me <\s>
<s> and that's lucky it'll make it easier for me to back his wife <\s>
<s> half artist and half forsyte jolyon was constitutionally averse from what he termed ructions unless angered he conformed deeply to that classic description of the she dog er'd ruther run than fight <\s>
<s> a little smile became settled in his beard <\s>
<s> ironical that soames should come down here to this house built for himself <\s>
<s> how he had gazed and gaped at this ruin of his past intention furtively nosing at the walls and stairway appraising everything <\s>
<s> and intuitively jolyon thought i believe the fellow even now would like to be living here <\s>
<s> he could never leave off longing for what he once owned <\s>
<s> well i must act somehow or other but it's a bore a great bore <\s>
<s> late that evening he wrote to the chelsea flat asking if irene would see him <\s>
<s> the old century which had seen the plant of individualism flower so wonderfully was setting in a sky orange with coming storms <\s>
<s> rumours of war added to the briskness of a london turbulent at the close of the summer holidays <\s>
<s> and the streets to jolyon who was not often up in town had a feverish look due to these new motorcars and cabs of which he disapproved aesthetically <\s>
<s> he counted these vehicles from his hansom and made the proportion of them one in twenty <\s>
<s> they were one in thirty about a year ago he thought they've come to stay <\s>
<s> just so much more rattling round of wheels and general stink' for he was one of those rather rare liberals who object to anything new when it takes a material form and he instructed his driver to get down to the river quickly out of the traffic desiring to look at the water through the mellowing screen of plane trees <\s>
<s> at the little block of flats which stood back some fifty yards from the embankment he told the cabman to wait and went up to the first floor <\s>
<s> heron was at home <\s>
<s> the effect of a settled if very modest income was at once apparent to him remembering the threadbare refinement in that tiny flat eight years ago when he announced her good fortune <\s>
<s> everything was now fresh dainty and smelled of flowers <\s>
<s> the general effect was silvery with touches of black hydrangea colour and gold <\s>
<s> a woman of great taste he thought <\s>
<s> time had dealt gently with jolyon for he was a forsyte <\s>
<s> but with irene time hardly seemed to deal at all or such was his impression <\s>
<s> she appeared to him not a day older standing there in mole coloured velvet corduroy with soft dark eyes and dark gold hair with outstretched hand and a little smile <\s>
<s> won't you sit down <\s>
<s> he had probably never occupied a chair with a fuller sense of embarrassment <\s>
<s> you look absolutely unchanged he said <\s>
<s> and you look younger cousin jolyon <\s>
<s> jolyon ran his hands through his hair whose thickness was still a comfort to him <\s>
<s> i'm ancient but i don't feel it <\s>
<s> that's one thing about painting it keeps you young <\s>
<s> titian lived to ninety nine and had to have plague to kill him off <\s>
<s> do you know the first time i ever saw you i thought of a picture by him <\s>
<s> when did you see me for the first time <\s>
<s> in the botanical gardens <\s>
<s> how did you know me if you'd never seen me before <\s>
<s> by someone who came up to you <\s>
<s> he was looking at her hardily but her face did not change and she said quietly yes many lives ago <\s>
<s> what is your recipe for youth irene <\s>
<s> people who don't live are wonderfully preserved <\s>
<s> a bitter little saying <\s>
<s> people who don't live <\s>
