<s> but having as the simple say learned his boy to draw pigs and other animals he knew that jon would never be a painter and inclined to the conclusion that his aversion from everything else meant that he was going to be a writer <\s>
<s> holding however the view that experience was necessary even for that profession there seemed to jolyon nothing in the meantime for jon but university travel and perhaps the eating of dinners for the bar <\s>
<s> after that one would see or more probably one would not <\s>
<s> in face of these proffered allurements however jon had remained undecided <\s>
<s> such discussions with his son had confirmed in jolyon a doubt whether the world had really changed <\s>
<s> people said that it was a new age <\s>
<s> with the profundity of one not too long for any age jolyon perceived that under slightly different surfaces the era was precisely what it had been <\s>
<s> mankind was still divided into two species the few who had speculation in their souls and the many who had none with a belt of hybrids like himself in the middle <\s>
<s> jon appeared to have speculation it seemed to his father a bad lookout <\s>
<s> with something deeper therefore than his usual smile he had heard the boy say a fortnight ago i should like to try farming dad if it won't cost you too much <\s>
<s> it seems to be about the only sort of life that doesn't hurt anybody except art and of course that's out of the question for me <\s>
<s> jolyon subdued his smile and answered all right you shall skip back to where we were under the first jolyon in 1760 <\s>
<s> it'll prove the cycle theory and incidentally no doubt you may grow a better turnip than he did <\s>
<s> a little dashed jon had answered but don't you think it's a good scheme dad <\s>
<s> twill serve my dear and if you should really take to it you'll do more good than most men which is little enough <\s>
<s> to himself however he had said but he won't take to it <\s>
<s> i give him four years <\s>
<s> still it's healthy and harmless <\s>
<s> after turning the matter over and consulting with irene he wrote to his daughter mrs <\s>
<s> val dartie asking if they knew of a farmer near them on the downs who would take jon as an apprentice <\s>
<s> holly's answer had been enthusiastic <\s>
<s> there was an excellent man quite close she and val would love jon to live with them <\s>
