<s> good said young jolyon it's exactly what i've always said <\s>
<s> by the bye have you noticed that whenever one says good one always adds it's exactly what i've always said <\s>
<s> but if you ask me how i do it i answer because i'm a forsyte <\s>

<s> a forsyte replied young jolyon is not an uncommon animal <\s>
<s> there are hundreds among the members of this club <\s>

<s> we are of course all of us the slaves of property and i admit that it's a question of degree but what i call a forsyte is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property <\s>

<s> you talk of them said bosinney as if they were half england <\s>

<s> i don't know whether i catch your drift said bosinney but i fancy there are plenty of forsytes as you call them in my profession <\s>

<s> a forsyte replied young jolyon is not an uncommon animal <\s>
<s> there are hundreds among the members of this club <\s>

<s> we are of course all of us the slaves of property and i admit that it's a question of degree but what i call a forsyte is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property <\s>

<s> a forsyte replied young jolyon is not an uncommon animal <\s>
<s> there are hundreds among the members of this club <\s>

<s> we are of course all of us the slaves of property and i admit that it's a question of degree but what i call a forsyte is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property <\s>
