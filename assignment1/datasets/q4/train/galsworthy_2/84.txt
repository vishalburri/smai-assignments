<s> one can't be absolutely sure but it's most unlikely <\s>
<s> she's strong said soames we'll take the risk <\s>
<s> the doctor looked at him very gravely <\s>
<s> it's on your shoulders he said with my own wife i couldn't <\s>
<s> soames chin jerked up as if someone had hit him <\s>
<s> and he would live to a green old age like his dear father and forget all about irene and that dreadful case <\s>
<s> if only she herself could be here to buy his children their first rocking horse <\s>
<s> smither should choose it for her at the stores nice and dappled <\s>
<s> how roger used to rock her until she fell off <\s>
<s> that was a long time ago <\s>
<s> in my father's house are many mansions 'a little scrattling noise caught her ear 'but no mice <\s>
<s> it was a mouse <\s>
<s> how naughty of smither to say there wasn't <\s>
<s> it would be eating through the wainscot before they knew where they were and they would have to have the builders in <\s>
<s> they were such destructive things <\s>
<s> and she lay with her eyes just moving following in her mind that little scrattling sound and waiting for sleep to release her from it <\s>
<s> chapter xii birth of a forsyte soames walked out of the garden door crossed the lawn stood on the path above the river turned round and walked back to the garden door without having realised that he had moved <\s>
<s> the sound of wheels crunching the drive convinced him that time had passed and the doctor gone <\s>
<s> what exactly had he said <\s>
<s> this is the position mr <\s>
<s> i can make pretty certain of her life if i operate but the baby will be born dead <\s>
<s> if i don't operate the baby will most probably be born alive but it's a great risk for the mother a great risk <\s>
<s> in either case i don't think she can ever have another child <\s>
<s> in her state she obviously can't decide for herself and we can't wait for her mother <\s>
<s> it's for you to make the decision while i'm getting what's necessary <\s>
<s> i shall be back within the hour <\s>
<s> no time to get a specialist down <\s>
<s> no time for anything <\s>
<s> the sound of wheels died away but soames still stood intent then suddenly covering his ears he walked back to the river <\s>
<s> to come before its time like this with no chance to foresee anything not even to get her mother here <\s>
<s> it was for her mother to make that decision and she couldn't arrive from paris till to night <\s>
<s> if only he could have understood the doctor's jargon the medical niceties so as to be sure he was weighing the chances properly but they were greek to him like a legal problem to a layman <\s>
<s> and yet he must decide <\s>
<s> he brought his hand away from his brow wet though the air was chilly <\s>
<s> these sounds which came from her room <\s>
<s> to go back there would only make it more difficult <\s>
<s> he must be calm clear <\s>
<s> on the one hand life nearly certain of his young wife death quite certain of his child and no more children afterwards <\s>
<s> on the other death perhaps of his wife nearly certain life for the child and no more children afterwards <\s>
<s> which to choose .... <\s>
<s> it had rained this last fortnight the river was very full and in the water collected round the little house boat moored by his landing stage were many leaves from the woods above brought off by a frost <\s>
<s> leaves fell lives drifted down death <\s>
<s> to decide about death <\s>
<s> and no one to give him a hand <\s>
<s> life lost was lost for good <\s>
<s> let nothing go that you could keep for if it went you couldn't get it back <\s>
<s> it left you bare like those trees when they lost their leaves barer and barer until you too withered and came down <\s>
<s> and by a queer somersault of thought he seemed to see not annette lying up there behind that window pane on which the sun was shining but irene lying in their bedroom in montpellier square as it might conceivably have been her fate to lie sixteen years ago <\s>
<s> would he have hesitated then <\s>
<s> make certain of her life <\s>
<s> no decision a mere instinctive cry for help in spite of his knowledge even then that she did not love him <\s>
<s> there was nothing overmastering in his feeling for annette <\s>
<s> many times these last months especially since she had been growing frightened he had wondered <\s>
<s> she had a will of her own was selfish in her french way <\s>
<s> what would she wish to take the risk <\s>
<s> i know she wants the child he thought <\s>
<s> if it's born dead and no more chance afterwards it'll upset her terribly <\s>
<s> married life with her for years and years without a child <\s>
<s> nothing to steady her <\s>
<s> nothing to look forward to for her for me <\s>
<s> he struck his hands against his chest <\s>
<s> why couldn't he think without bringing himself in get out of himself and see what he ought to do <\s>
<s> the thought hurt him then lost edge as if it had come in contact with a breastplate <\s>
<s> out into soundless scentless touchless sightless space <\s>
<s> the very idea was ghastly futile <\s>
<s> and touching there the bedrock of reality the bottom of his forsyte spirit soames rested for a moment <\s>
<s> when one ceased all ceased it might go on but there'd be nothing in it <\s>
<s> he looked at his watch <\s>
<s> in half an hour the doctor would be back <\s>
<s> if against the operation and she died how face her mother and the doctor afterwards <\s>
<s> how face his own conscience <\s>
<s> it was his child that she was having <\s>
<s> if for the operation then he condemned them both to childlessness <\s>
<s> and for what else had he married her but to have a lawful heir <\s>
<s> and his father at death's door waiting for the news <\s>
<s> he thought i ought never to have such a thing to settle <\s>
<s> he turned towards the house <\s>
<s> some deep simple way of deciding <\s>
<s> he took out a coin and put it back <\s>
<s> if he spun it he knew he would not abide by what came up <\s>
<s> he went into the dining room furthest away from that room whence the sounds issued <\s>
<s> the doctor had said there was a chance <\s>
<s> in here that chance seemed greater the river did not flow nor the leaves fall <\s>
<s> a fire was burning <\s>
<s> soames unlocked the tantalus <\s>
<s> he hardly ever touched spirits but now he poured himself out some whisky and drank it neat craving a faster flow of blood <\s>
<s> that fellow jolyon he thought he had children already <\s>
<s> he has the woman i really loved and now a son by her <\s>
<s> and i i'm asked to destroy my only child <\s>
<s> annette can't die it's not possible <\s>
<s> he was still standing sullenly at the sideboard when he heard the doctor's carriage and went out to him <\s>
<s> he had to wait for him to come downstairs <\s>
<s> the situation's the same <\s>
<s> yes said soames don't operate <\s>
<s> you understand the risk's great <\s>
<s> in soames set face nothing moved but the lips <\s>
<s> you said there was a chance <\s>
<s> a chance yes not much of one <\s>
<s> you say the baby must be born dead if you do <\s>
<s> do you still think that in any case she can't have another <\s>
<s> one can't be absolutely sure but it's most unlikely <\s>
<s> she's strong said soames we'll take the risk <\s>
<s> the doctor looked at him very gravely <\s>
<s> it's on your shoulders he said with my own wife i couldn't <\s>
<s> soames chin jerked up as if someone had hit him <\s>
