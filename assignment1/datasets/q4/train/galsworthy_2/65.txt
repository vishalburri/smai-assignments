<s> i never said anything about our ride val <\s>

<s> do tell me about oxford <\s>

<s> val admitted that it was frightfully decent to do what you liked the lectures were nothing and there were some very good chaps <\s>
<s> only he added of course i wish i was in town and could come down and see you <\s>
<s> holly moved one hand shyly on her knee and her glance dropped <\s>
<s> you haven't forgotten he said suddenly gathering courage that we're going mad rabbiting together <\s>
<s> that was only make believe <\s>
<s> one can't do that sort of thing after one's grown up you know <\s>
<s> cousins can said val <\s>
<s> next long vac it begins in june you know and goes on for ever we'll watch our chance <\s>
<s> but though the thrill of conspiracy ran through her veins holly shook her head <\s>
<s> it won't come off she murmured <\s>
<s> said val fervently who's going to stop it <\s>
<s> not your father or your brother <\s>
<s> at this moment jolyon and jolly came in and romance fled into val's patent leather and holly's white satin toes where it itched and tingled during an evening not conspicuous for open heartedness <\s>

<s> a letter handed to him after dinner reduced him to a silence hardly broken till jolly and val rose to go <\s>
<s> he went out with them smoking his cigar and walked with his son to the gates of christ church <\s>

<s> dear jolyon soames came again to night my thirty seventh birthday <\s>
<s> you were right i mustn't stay here <\s>
<s> i'm going to morrow to the piedmont hotel but i won't go abroad without seeing you <\s>
<s> i feel lonely and down hearted <\s>
<s> he folded the letter back into his pocket and walked on astonished at the violence of his feelings <\s>
<s> what had the fellow said or done <\s>
<s> he turned into high street down the turf and on among a maze of spires and domes and long college fronts and walls bright or dark shadowed in the strong moonlight <\s>
<s> in this very heart of england's gentility it was difficult to realise that a lonely woman could be importuned or hunted but what else could her letter mean <\s>
<s> soames must have been pressing her to go back to him again with public opinion and the law on his side too <\s>
<s> eighteen ninety nine he thought gazing at the broken glass shining on the top of a villa garden wall but when it comes to property we're still a heathen people <\s>
<s> i'll go up to morrow morning <\s>
<s> i dare say it'll be best for her to go abroad <\s>
<s> yet the thought displeased him <\s>
<s> why should soames hunt her out of england <\s>
<s> besides he might follow and out there she would be still more helpless against the attentions of her own husband <\s>
<s> i must tread warily he thought that fellow could make himself very nasty <\s>
<s> i didn't like his manner in the cab the other night <\s>
<s> his thoughts turned to his daughter june <\s>
<s> once on a time irene had been her greatest friend and now she was a lame duck such as must appeal to june's nature <\s>
<s> he determined to wire to his daughter to meet him at paddington station <\s>
<s> retracing his steps towards the rainbow he questioned his own sensations <\s>
<s> would he be upsetting himself over every woman in like case <\s>
<s> the candour of this conclusion discomfited him and finding that holly had gone up to bed he sought his own room <\s>
<s> but he could not sleep and sat for a long time at his window huddled in an overcoat watching the moonlight on the roofs <\s>
