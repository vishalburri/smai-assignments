<s> love filled his soul that love of boy for girl which knows so little hopes so much would not brush the down off for the world and must become in time a fragrant memory a searing passion a humdrum mateship or once in many times vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes <\s>

<s> he gazed at his mother while she played but he saw fleur fleur in the moonlit orchard fleur in the sunlit gravel pit fleur in that fancy dress swaying whispering stooping kissing his forehead <\s>
<s> once while he listened he forgot himself and glanced at his father in that other easy chair <\s>
<s> what was dad looking like that for <\s>
<s> the expression on his face was so sad and puzzling <\s>
<s> it filled him with a sort of remorse so that he got up and went and sat on the arm of his father's chair <\s>
<s> from there he could not see his face and again he saw fleur in his mother's hands slim and white on the keys in the profile of her face and her powdery hair and down the long room in the open window where the may night walked outside <\s>
<s> when he went up to bed his mother came into his room <\s>
<s> she stood at the window and said those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done wonderfully <\s>
<s> i always think they look beautiful under a dropping moon <\s>
<s> i wish you had known your grandfather jon <\s>
<s> were you married to father when he was alive <\s>
<s> no dear he died in 92 very old eighty five i think <\s>
<s> is father like him <\s>
<s> a little but more subtle and not quite so solid <\s>
<s> i know from grandfather's portrait who painted that <\s>
<s> one of june's lame ducks <\s>
<s> but it's quite good <\s>
<s> jon slipped his hand through his mother's arm <\s>
<s> tell me about the family quarrel mum <\s>
<s> he felt her arm quivering <\s>
<s> no dear that's for your father some day if he thinks fit <\s>
<s> then it was serious said jon with a catch in his breath <\s>
<s> and there was a silence during which neither knew whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most <\s>
<s> some people said irene softly think the moon on her back is evil to me she's always lovely <\s>
<s> look at those cypress shadows <\s>
<s> jon father says we may go to italy you and i for two months <\s>
<s> jon took his hand from under her arm his sensation was so sharp and so confused <\s>
<s> italy with his mother <\s>
<s> a fortnight ago it would have been perfection now it filled him with dismay he felt that the sudden suggestion had to do with fleur <\s>
<s> he stammered out oh <\s>
<s> yes only i don't know <\s>
<s> ought i now i've just begun <\s>
<s> i'd like to think it over <\s>
<s> and that fellow's grin <\s>
<s> he turned abruptly from the window <\s>
<s> he couldn't spy on her <\s>
<s> if she wanted to keep things from him she must he could not spy on her <\s>
<s> his heart felt empty and bitterness mounted from it into his very mouth <\s>
<s> the staccato shouts of jack cardigan pursuing the ball the laugh of young mont rose in the stillness and came in <\s>
<s> he hoped they were making that chap profond run <\s>
<s> and the girl in la vendimia stood with her arm akimbo and her dreamy eyes looking past him <\s>
<s> i've done all i could for you he thought since you were no higher than my knee <\s>
<s> you aren't going to to hurt me are you <\s>
<s> but the goya copy answered not brilliant in colour just beginning to tone down <\s>
<s> there's no real life in it thought soames <\s>
<s> why doesn't she come <\s>
<s> x trio among those four forsytes of the third and as one might say fourth generation at wansdon under the downs a week end prolonged unto the ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity almost to snapping point <\s>
<s> never had fleur been so fine holly so watchful val so stable secretive jon so silent and disturbed <\s>
<s> what he learned of farming in that week might have been balanced on the point of a penknife and puffed off <\s>
<s> he whose nature was essentially averse from intrigue and whose adoration of fleur disposed him to think that any need for concealing it was skittles chafed and fretted yet obeyed taking what relief he could in the few moments when they were alone <\s>
<s> on thursday while they were standing in the bay window of the drawing room dressed for dinner she said to him jon i'm going home on sunday by the 3.40 from paddington if you were to go home on saturday you could come up on sunday and take me down and just get back here by the last train after <\s>
<s> you were going home anyway weren't you <\s>
<s> anything to be with you he said only why need i pretend fleur slipped her little finger into his palm you have no instinct jon you must leave things to me <\s>
<s> it's serious about our people <\s>
<s> we've simply got to be secret at present if we want to be together <\s>
<s> the door was opened and she added loudly you are a duffer jon <\s>
<s> something turned over within jon he could not bear this subterfuge about a feeling so natural so overwhelming and so sweet <\s>
<s> on friday night about eleven he had packed his bag and was leaning out of his window half miserable and half lost in a dream of paddington station when he heard a tiny sound as of a finger nail tapping on his door <\s>
<s> he rushed to it and listened <\s>
<s> it was a nail <\s>
<s> what a lovely thing came in <\s>
<s> i wanted to show you my fancy dress it said and struck an attitude at the foot of his bed <\s>
<s> jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door <\s>
<s> the apparition wore white muslin on its head a fichu round its bare neck over a wine coloured dress fulled out below its slender waist <\s>
<s> it held one arm akimbo and the other raised right angled holding a fan which touched its head <\s>
<s> this ought to be a basket of grapes it whispered but i haven't got it here <\s>
<s> it's my goya dress <\s>
<s> and this is the attitude in the picture <\s>
<s> do you like it <\s>
<s> touch it and see <\s>
<s> jon knelt down and took the skirt reverently <\s>
<s> grape colour came the whisper all grapes la vendimia the vintage <\s>
<s> jon's fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist he looked up with adoring eyes <\s>
<s> jon it whispered bent kissed his forehead pirouetted again and gliding out was gone <\s>
<s> jon stayed on his knees and his head fell forward against the bed <\s>
<s> how long he stayed like that he did not know <\s>
<s> the little noises of the tapping nail the feet the skirts rustling as in a dream went on about him and before his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and whispered a faint perfume of narcissus lingering in the air <\s>
<s> and his forehead where it had been kissed had a little cool place between the brows like the imprint of a flower <\s>
<s> love filled his soul that love of boy for girl which knows so little hopes so much would not brush the down off for the world and must become in time a fragrant memory a searing passion a humdrum mateship or once in many times vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes <\s>
<s> enough has been said about jon forsyte here and in another place to show what long marches lay between him and his great great grandfather the first jolyon in dorset down by the sea <\s>
<s> jon was sensitive as a girl more sensitive than nine out of ten girls of the day imaginative as one of his half sister june's lame duck painters affectionate as a son of his father and his mother naturally would be <\s>
<s> and yet in his inner tissue there was something of the old founder of his family a secret tenacity of soul a dread of showing his feelings a determination not to know when he was beaten <\s>
<s> sensitive imaginative affectionate boys get a bad time at school but jon had instinctively kept his nature dark and been but normally unhappy there <\s>
<s> only with his mother had he up till then been absolutely frank and natural and when he went home to robin hill that saturday his heart was heavy because fleur had said that he must not be frank and natural with her from whom he had never yet kept anything must not even tell her that they had met again unless he found that she knew already <\s>
<s> so intolerable did this seem to him that he was very near to telegraphing an excuse and staying up in london <\s>
<s> and the first thing his mother said to him was so you've had our little friend of the confectioner's there jon <\s>
<s> what is she like on second thoughts <\s>
<s> with relief and a high colour jon answered oh <\s>
<s> her arm pressed his <\s>
<s> jon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed to falsify fleur's fears and to release his soul <\s>
<s> he turned to look at her but something in her smiling face something which only he perhaps would have caught stopped the words bubbling up in him <\s>
<s> could fear go with a smile <\s>
<s> if so there was fear in her face <\s>
<s> and out of jon tumbled quite other words about farming holly and the downs <\s>
<s> talking fast he waited for her to come back to fleur <\s>
<s> but she did not <\s>
<s> nor did his father mention her though of course he too must know <\s>

<s> anything to be with you he said only why need i pretend fleur slipped her little finger into his palm you have no instinct jon you must leave things to me <\s>
<s> it's serious about our people <\s>
<s> we've simply got to be secret at present if we want to be together <\s>
<s> the door was opened and she added loudly you are a duffer jon <\s>
<s> something turned over within jon he could not bear this subterfuge about a feeling so natural so overwhelming and so sweet <\s>
<s> on friday night about eleven he had packed his bag and was leaning out of his window half miserable and half lost in a dream of paddington station when he heard a tiny sound as of a finger nail tapping on his door <\s>
<s> he rushed to it and listened <\s>
<s> it was a nail <\s>
<s> what a lovely thing came in <\s>
<s> i wanted to show you my fancy dress it said and struck an attitude at the foot of his bed <\s>
<s> jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door <\s>
<s> the apparition wore white muslin on its head a fichu round its bare neck over a wine coloured dress fulled out below its slender waist <\s>
<s> it held one arm akimbo and the other raised right angled holding a fan which touched its head <\s>
<s> this ought to be a basket of grapes it whispered but i haven't got it here <\s>
<s> it's my goya dress <\s>
<s> and this is the attitude in the picture <\s>
<s> do you like it <\s>
<s> touch it and see <\s>
<s> jon knelt down and took the skirt reverently <\s>
<s> grape colour came the whisper all grapes la vendimia the vintage <\s>
<s> jon's fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist he looked up with adoring eyes <\s>
<s> jon it whispered bent kissed his forehead pirouetted again and gliding out was gone <\s>
<s> jon stayed on his knees and his head fell forward against the bed <\s>
<s> how long he stayed like that he did not know <\s>
<s> the little noises of the tapping nail the feet the skirts rustling as in a dream went on about him and before his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and whispered a faint perfume of narcissus lingering in the air <\s>
<s> and his forehead where it had been kissed had a little cool place between the brows like the imprint of a flower <\s>
<s> love filled his soul that love of boy for girl which knows so little hopes so much would not brush the down off for the world and must become in time a fragrant memory a searing passion a humdrum mateship or once in many times vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes <\s>
<s> enough has been said about jon forsyte here and in another place to show what long marches lay between him and his great great grandfather the first jolyon in dorset down by the sea <\s>
<s> jon was sensitive as a girl more sensitive than nine out of ten girls of the day imaginative as one of his half sister june's lame duck painters affectionate as a son of his father and his mother naturally would be <\s>
<s> and yet in his inner tissue there was something of the old founder of his family a secret tenacity of soul a dread of showing his feelings a determination not to know when he was beaten <\s>
<s> sensitive imaginative affectionate boys get a bad time at school but jon had instinctively kept his nature dark and been but normally unhappy there <\s>
<s> only with his mother had he up till then been absolutely frank and natural and when he went home to robin hill that saturday his heart was heavy because fleur had said that he must not be frank and natural with her from whom he had never yet kept anything must not even tell her that they had met again unless he found that she knew already <\s>
<s> so intolerable did this seem to him that he was very near to telegraphing an excuse and staying up in london <\s>
<s> and the first thing his mother said to him was so you've had our little friend of the confectioner's there jon <\s>
<s> what is she like on second thoughts <\s>
<s> with relief and a high colour jon answered oh <\s>
<s> her arm pressed his <\s>
<s> jon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed to falsify fleur's fears and to release his soul <\s>
<s> he turned to look at her but something in her smiling face something which only he perhaps would have caught stopped the words bubbling up in him <\s>
<s> could fear go with a smile <\s>
<s> if so there was fear in her face <\s>
<s> and out of jon tumbled quite other words about farming holly and the downs <\s>
<s> talking fast he waited for her to come back to fleur <\s>
<s> but she did not <\s>
<s> nor did his father mention her though of course he too must know <\s>
<s> what deprivation and killing of reality was in his silence about fleur when he was so full of her when his mother was so full of jon and his father so full of his mother <\s>
<s> and so the trio spent the evening of that saturday <\s>
<s> after dinner his mother played she seemed to play all the things he liked best and he sat with one knee clasped and his hair standing up where his fingers had run through it <\s>
<s> he gazed at his mother while she played but he saw fleur fleur in the moonlit orchard fleur in the sunlit gravel pit fleur in that fancy dress swaying whispering stooping kissing his forehead <\s>
<s> once while he listened he forgot himself and glanced at his father in that other easy chair <\s>
<s> what was dad looking like that for <\s>
<s> the expression on his face was so sad and puzzling <\s>
<s> it filled him with a sort of remorse so that he got up and went and sat on the arm of his father's chair <\s>
<s> from there he could not see his face and again he saw fleur in his mother's hands slim and white on the keys in the profile of her face and her powdery hair and down the long room in the open window where the may night walked outside <\s>
<s> when he went up to bed his mother came into his room <\s>
<s> she stood at the window and said those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done wonderfully <\s>
<s> i always think they look beautiful under a dropping moon <\s>
<s> i wish you had known your grandfather jon <\s>
<s> were you married to father when he was alive <\s>
<s> no dear he died in 92 very old eighty five i think <\s>
<s> is father like him <\s>
<s> a little but more subtle and not quite so solid <\s>
<s> i know from grandfather's portrait who painted that <\s>
<s> one of june's lame ducks <\s>
<s> but it's quite good <\s>
<s> jon slipped his hand through his mother's arm <\s>
<s> tell me about the family quarrel mum <\s>
<s> he felt her arm quivering <\s>
<s> no dear that's for your father some day if he thinks fit <\s>
<s> then it was serious said jon with a catch in his breath <\s>
<s> and there was a silence during which neither knew whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most <\s>
<s> some people said irene softly think the moon on her back is evil to me she's always lovely <\s>
<s> look at those cypress shadows <\s>
<s> jon father says we may go to italy you and i for two months <\s>
<s> jon took his hand from under her arm his sensation was so sharp and so confused <\s>
<s> italy with his mother <\s>
<s> a fortnight ago it would have been perfection now it filled him with dismay he felt that the sudden suggestion had to do with fleur <\s>
<s> he stammered out oh <\s>
<s> yes only i don't know <\s>
<s> ought i now i've just begun <\s>
<s> i'd like to think it over <\s>
<s> and that fellow's grin <\s>
<s> he turned abruptly from the window <\s>
<s> he couldn't spy on her <\s>
<s> if she wanted to keep things from him she must he could not spy on her <\s>
<s> his heart felt empty and bitterness mounted from it into his very mouth <\s>
<s> the staccato shouts of jack cardigan pursuing the ball the laugh of young mont rose in the stillness and came in <\s>
<s> he hoped they were making that chap profond run <\s>
<s> and the girl in la vendimia stood with her arm akimbo and her dreamy eyes looking past him <\s>
<s> i've done all i could for you he thought since you were no higher than my knee <\s>
<s> you aren't going to to hurt me are you <\s>
<s> but the goya copy answered not brilliant in colour just beginning to tone down <\s>
<s> there's no real life in it thought soames <\s>
<s> why doesn't she come <\s>
<s> x trio among those four forsytes of the third and as one might say fourth generation at wansdon under the downs a week end prolonged unto the ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity almost to snapping point <\s>

<s> x trio among those four forsytes of the third and as one might say fourth generation at wansdon under the downs a week end prolonged unto the ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity almost to snapping point <\s>
<s> never had fleur been so fine holly so watchful val so stable secretive jon so silent and disturbed <\s>
<s> what he learned of farming in that week might have been balanced on the point of a penknife and puffed off <\s>
<s> he whose nature was essentially averse from intrigue and whose adoration of fleur disposed him to think that any need for concealing it was skittles chafed and fretted yet obeyed taking what relief he could in the few moments when they were alone <\s>
<s> on thursday while they were standing in the bay window of the drawing room dressed for dinner she said to him jon i'm going home on sunday by the 3.40 from paddington if you were to go home on saturday you could come up on sunday and take me down and just get back here by the last train after <\s>
<s> you were going home anyway weren't you <\s>
<s> anything to be with you he said only why need i pretend fleur slipped her little finger into his palm you have no instinct jon you must leave things to me <\s>
<s> it's serious about our people <\s>
<s> we've simply got to be secret at present if we want to be together <\s>
<s> the door was opened and she added loudly you are a duffer jon <\s>
<s> something turned over within jon he could not bear this subterfuge about a feeling so natural so overwhelming and so sweet <\s>
<s> on friday night about eleven he had packed his bag and was leaning out of his window half miserable and half lost in a dream of paddington station when he heard a tiny sound as of a finger nail tapping on his door <\s>
<s> he rushed to it and listened <\s>
<s> it was a nail <\s>
<s> what a lovely thing came in <\s>
<s> i wanted to show you my fancy dress it said and struck an attitude at the foot of his bed <\s>
<s> jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door <\s>
<s> the apparition wore white muslin on its head a fichu round its bare neck over a wine coloured dress fulled out below its slender waist <\s>
<s> it held one arm akimbo and the other raised right angled holding a fan which touched its head <\s>
<s> this ought to be a basket of grapes it whispered but i haven't got it here <\s>
<s> it's my goya dress <\s>
<s> and this is the attitude in the picture <\s>
<s> do you like it <\s>
<s> touch it and see <\s>
<s> jon knelt down and took the skirt reverently <\s>
<s> grape colour came the whisper all grapes la vendimia the vintage <\s>
<s> jon's fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist he looked up with adoring eyes <\s>
<s> jon it whispered bent kissed his forehead pirouetted again and gliding out was gone <\s>
<s> jon stayed on his knees and his head fell forward against the bed <\s>
<s> how long he stayed like that he did not know <\s>
<s> the little noises of the tapping nail the feet the skirts rustling as in a dream went on about him and before his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and whispered a faint perfume of narcissus lingering in the air <\s>
<s> and his forehead where it had been kissed had a little cool place between the brows like the imprint of a flower <\s>
<s> love filled his soul that love of boy for girl which knows so little hopes so much would not brush the down off for the world and must become in time a fragrant memory a searing passion a humdrum mateship or once in many times vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes <\s>
<s> enough has been said about jon forsyte here and in another place to show what long marches lay between him and his great great grandfather the first jolyon in dorset down by the sea <\s>
<s> jon was sensitive as a girl more sensitive than nine out of ten girls of the day imaginative as one of his half sister june's lame duck painters affectionate as a son of his father and his mother naturally would be <\s>
<s> and yet in his inner tissue there was something of the old founder of his family a secret tenacity of soul a dread of showing his feelings a determination not to know when he was beaten <\s>
<s> sensitive imaginative affectionate boys get a bad time at school but jon had instinctively kept his nature dark and been but normally unhappy there <\s>
<s> only with his mother had he up till then been absolutely frank and natural and when he went home to robin hill that saturday his heart was heavy because fleur had said that he must not be frank and natural with her from whom he had never yet kept anything must not even tell her that they had met again unless he found that she knew already <\s>
<s> so intolerable did this seem to him that he was very near to telegraphing an excuse and staying up in london <\s>
<s> and the first thing his mother said to him was so you've had our little friend of the confectioner's there jon <\s>
<s> what is she like on second thoughts <\s>
<s> with relief and a high colour jon answered oh <\s>
<s> her arm pressed his <\s>
<s> jon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed to falsify fleur's fears and to release his soul <\s>
<s> he turned to look at her but something in her smiling face something which only he perhaps would have caught stopped the words bubbling up in him <\s>
<s> could fear go with a smile <\s>
<s> if so there was fear in her face <\s>
<s> and out of jon tumbled quite other words about farming holly and the downs <\s>
<s> talking fast he waited for her to come back to fleur <\s>
<s> but she did not <\s>
<s> nor did his father mention her though of course he too must know <\s>
<s> what deprivation and killing of reality was in his silence about fleur when he was so full of her when his mother was so full of jon and his father so full of his mother <\s>
<s> and so the trio spent the evening of that saturday <\s>
<s> after dinner his mother played she seemed to play all the things he liked best and he sat with one knee clasped and his hair standing up where his fingers had run through it <\s>
<s> he gazed at his mother while she played but he saw fleur fleur in the moonlit orchard fleur in the sunlit gravel pit fleur in that fancy dress swaying whispering stooping kissing his forehead <\s>
<s> once while he listened he forgot himself and glanced at his father in that other easy chair <\s>
<s> what was dad looking like that for <\s>
<s> the expression on his face was so sad and puzzling <\s>
<s> it filled him with a sort of remorse so that he got up and went and sat on the arm of his father's chair <\s>
<s> from there he could not see his face and again he saw fleur in his mother's hands slim and white on the keys in the profile of her face and her powdery hair and down the long room in the open window where the may night walked outside <\s>
<s> when he went up to bed his mother came into his room <\s>
<s> she stood at the window and said those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done wonderfully <\s>
<s> i always think they look beautiful under a dropping moon <\s>
<s> i wish you had known your grandfather jon <\s>
<s> were you married to father when he was alive <\s>
<s> no dear he died in 92 very old eighty five i think <\s>
<s> is father like him <\s>
<s> a little but more subtle and not quite so solid <\s>
<s> i know from grandfather's portrait who painted that <\s>
<s> one of june's lame ducks <\s>
<s> but it's quite good <\s>
<s> jon slipped his hand through his mother's arm <\s>
<s> tell me about the family quarrel mum <\s>
<s> he felt her arm quivering <\s>
<s> no dear that's for your father some day if he thinks fit <\s>
<s> then it was serious said jon with a catch in his breath <\s>
<s> and there was a silence during which neither knew whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most <\s>
<s> some people said irene softly think the moon on her back is evil to me she's always lovely <\s>
<s> look at those cypress shadows <\s>
<s> jon father says we may go to italy you and i for two months <\s>
<s> jon took his hand from under her arm his sensation was so sharp and so confused <\s>
<s> italy with his mother <\s>
<s> a fortnight ago it would have been perfection now it filled him with dismay he felt that the sudden suggestion had to do with fleur <\s>
<s> he stammered out oh <\s>
<s> yes only i don't know <\s>
<s> ought i now i've just begun <\s>
<s> i'd like to think it over <\s>
