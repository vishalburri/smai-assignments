<s> while he was eating his jam beneath the oak tree he noticed things about his mother that he had never seemed to see before her cheeks for instance were creamy there were silver threads in her dark goldy hair her throat had no knob in it like bella's and she went in and out softly <\s>

<s> she was ever so beautiful more beautiful than da or mademoiselle or auntie june or even auntie holly to whom he had taken a fancy even more beautiful than bella who had pink cheeks and came out too suddenly in places <\s>

<s> he had a long conversation with his father about things in general avoiding his private life sir lamorac the austrians and the emptiness he had felt these last three days now so suddenly filled up <\s>

<s> little jon came to a halt with his heels apart <\s>
<s> do you really believe they do daddy <\s>
<s> no jon but i thought you might <\s>
<s> you're younger than i and they're fairies <\s>
<s> little jon squared the dimple in his chin <\s>
<s> i don't believe in fairies <\s>
<s> i never see any <\s>
<s> his father smiled his funny smile <\s>
<s> no she only sees pan <\s>
<s> the goaty god who skips about in wild and beautiful places <\s>
<s> was he in glensofantrim <\s>
<s> little jon took his heels up and led on <\s>
<s> did you see him <\s>
<s> no i only saw venus anadyomene <\s>
<s> little jon reflected venus was in his book about the greeks and trojans <\s>
<s> then anna was her christian and dyomene her surname <\s>
<s> but it appeared on inquiry that it was one word which meant rising from the foam <\s>
<s> did she rise from the foam in glensofantrim <\s>
<s> what is she like daddy <\s>
<s> then she must be ... <\s>
<s> but he stopped at that rushed at a wall scrambled up and promptly scrambled down again <\s>
<s> the discovery that his mother was beautiful was one which he felt must absolutely be kept to himself <\s>
<s> his father's cigar however took so long to smoke that at last he was compelled to say i want to see what mum's brought home <\s>
<s> do you mind daddy <\s>
<s> he pitched the motive low to absolve him from unmanliness and was a little disconcerted when his father looked at him right through heaved an important sigh and answered all right old man you go and love her <\s>
<s> he went with a pretence of slowness and then rushed to make up <\s>
<s> he entered her bedroom from his own the door being open <\s>
<s> she was still kneeling before a trunk and he stood close to her quite still <\s>
<s> she knelt up straight and said well jon <\s>
<s> i thought i'd just come and see <\s>
<s> having given and received another hug he mounted the window seat and tucking his legs up under him watched her unpack <\s>
<s> he derived a pleasure from the operation such as he had not yet known partly because she was taking out things which looked suspicious and partly because he liked to look at her <\s>
<s> those last two days had seemed months in spite of cast up by the sea wherein he was reading about mother lee and her terrible wrecking bonfire <\s>
<s> he had gone up and down the stairs perhaps a hundred times in those two days and often from the day nursery where he slept now had stolen into his mother's room looked at everything without touching and on into the dressing room and standing on one leg beside the bath like slingsby had whispered ho ho ho <\s>
<s> mysteriously to bring luck <\s>
<s> then stealing back he had opened his mother's wardrobe and taken a long sniff which seemed to bring him nearer to he didn't know what <\s>
<s> he had done this just before he stood in the streak of sunlight debating in which of the several ways he should slide down the banisters <\s>
<s> they all seemed silly and in a sudden languor he began descending the steps one by one <\s>
<s> during that descent he could remember his father quite distinctly the short grey beard the deep eyes twinkling the furrow between them the funny smile the thin figure which always seemed so tall to little jon but his mother he couldn't see <\s>
<s> all that represented her was something swaying with two dark eyes looking back at him and the scent of her wardrobe <\s>
<s> bella was in the hall drawing aside the big curtains and opening the front door <\s>
<s> little jon said wheedling bella <\s>
<s> do let's have tea under the oak tree when they come i know they'd like it best <\s>
<s> you mean you'd like it best <\s>
<s> no they would to please me <\s>
<s> very well i'll take it out if you'll stay quiet here and not get into mischief before they come <\s>
<s> little jon sat down on the bottom step and nodded <\s>
<s> bella came close and looked him over <\s>
<s> little jon got up <\s>
<s> she scrutinized him behind he was not green and his knees seemed clean <\s>
<s> give me a kiss <\s>
<s> and little jon received a peck on his hair <\s>
<s> i'm so tired of waiting <\s>
<s> they were his favourites <\s>
<s> when she was gone he sat still for quite a minute <\s>
<s> it was quiet in the big hall open to its east end so that he could see one of his trees a brig sailing very slowly across the upper lawn <\s>
<s> in the outer hall shadows were slanting from the pillars <\s>
<s> little jon got up jumped one of them and walked round the clump of iris plants which filled the pool of grey white marble in the centre <\s>
<s> the flowers were pretty but only smelled a very little <\s>
<s> he stood in the open doorway and looked out <\s>
<s> suppose suppose they didn't come <\s>
<s> he had waited so long that he felt he could not bear that and his attention slid at once from such finality to the dust motes in the bluish sunlight coming in thrusting his hand up he tried to catch some <\s>
<s> bella ought to have dusted that piece of air <\s>
<s> but perhaps they weren't dust only what sunlight was made of and he looked to see whether the sunlight out of doors was the same <\s>
<s> he had said he would stay quiet in the hall but he simply couldn't any more and crossing the gravel of the drive he lay down on the grass beyond <\s>
<s> pulling six daisies he named them carefully sir lamorac sir tristram sir lancelot sir palimedes sir bors sir gawain and fought them in couples till only sir lamorac whom he had selected for a specially stout stalk had his head on and even he after three encounters looked worn and waggly <\s>
<s> a beetle was moving slowly in the grass which almost wanted cutting <\s>
<s> every blade was a small tree round whose trunk the beetle had to glide <\s>
<s> little jon stretched out sir lamorac feet foremost and stirred the creature up <\s>
<s> little jon laughed lost interest and sighed <\s>
<s> his heart felt empty <\s>
<s> he turned over and lay on his back <\s>
<s> there was a scent of honey from the lime trees in flower and in the sky the blue was beautiful with a few white clouds which looked and perhaps tasted like lemon ice <\s>
<s> he could hear bob playing way down upon de suwannee ribber on his concertina and it made him nice and sad <\s>
<s> he turned over again and put his ear to the ground indians could hear things coming ever so far but he could hear nothing only the concertina <\s>
<s> and almost instantly he did hear a grinding sound a faint toot <\s>
<s> it was a car coming coming <\s>
<s> should he wait in the porch or rush upstairs and as they came in shout look <\s>
<s> and slide slowly down the banisters head foremost <\s>
<s> the car turned in at the drive <\s>
<s> it was too late <\s>
<s> and he only waited jumping up and down in his excitement <\s>
<s> the car came quickly whirred and stopped <\s>
<s> his father got out exactly like life <\s>
<s> he bent down and little jon bobbed up they bumped <\s>
<s> his father said bless us <\s>
<s> well old man you are brown <\s>
<s> just as he would and the sense of expectation of something wanted bubbled unextinguished in little jon <\s>
<s> then with a long shy look he saw his mother in a blue dress with a blue motor scarf over her cap and hair smiling <\s>
<s> he jumped as high as ever he could twined his legs behind her back and hugged <\s>
<s> he heard her gasp and felt her hugging back <\s>
<s> his eyes very dark blue just then looked into hers very dark brown till her lips closed on his eyebrow and squeezing with all his might he heard her creak and laugh and say you are strong jon <\s>
