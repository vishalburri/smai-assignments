<s> soames who still held her hand was overcome by an impulse which surprised him <\s>
<s> you look so pretty to night he said so very pretty <\s>
<s> do you know how pretty you look annette <\s>
<s> annette withdrew her hand and blushed <\s>
<s> monsieur is very good <\s>
<s> not a bit good said soames and sat down gloomily <\s>
<s> annette made a little expressive gesture with her hands a smile was crinkling her red lips untouched by salve <\s>
<s> and looking at those lips soames said are you happy over here or do you want to go back to france <\s>
<s> oh i like london <\s>
<s> but london is better than orleans and the english country is so beautiful <\s>
<s> or being too drunk to undress himself or no i can't bring in the children <\s>
<s> no said soames no <\s>
<s> of course there's legal separation we can get that <\s>
<s> what does it mean <\s>
<s> that he can't touch you or you him you're both of you married and unmarried <\s>
<s> and again he grunted <\s>
<s> what was it in fact but his own accursed position legalised <\s>
<s> no he would not put her into that <\s>
<s> it must be divorce he said decisively failing cruelty there's desertion <\s>
<s> there's a way of shortening the two years now <\s>
<s> we get the court to give us restitution of conjugal rights <\s>
<s> then if he doesn't obey we can bring a suit for divorce in six months time <\s>
<s> of course you don't want him back <\s>
<s> but they won't know that <\s>
<s> still there's the risk that he might come <\s>
<s> i'd rather try cruelty <\s>
<s> winifred shook her head <\s>
<s> well soames murmured perhaps there isn't much risk so long as he's infatuated and got money <\s>
<s> don't say anything to anybody and don't pay any of his debts <\s>
<s> in spite of all she had been through the sense of loss was heavy on her <\s>
<s> and this idea of not paying his debts any more brought it home to her as nothing else yet had <\s>
<s> some richness seemed to have gone out of life <\s>
<s> without her husband without her pearls without that intimate sense that she made a brave show above the domestic whirlpool she would now have to face the world <\s>
<s> she felt bereaved indeed <\s>
<s> and into the chilly kiss he placed on her forehead soames put more than his usual warmth <\s>
<s> i have to go down to robin hill to morrow he said to see young jolyon on business <\s>
<s> he's got a boy at oxford <\s>
<s> i'd like to take val with me and introduce him <\s>
<s> come down to the shelter for the week end and bring the children <\s>
<s> by the way no that won't do; i've got some other people coming <\s>
<s> so saying he left her and turned towards soho <\s>
<s> chapter iv soho of all quarters in the queer adventurous amalgam called london soho is perhaps least suited to the forsyte spirit <\s>
<s> so ho my wild one <\s>
<s> george would have said if he had seen his cousin going there <\s>
<s> untidy full of greeks ishmaelites cats italians tomatoes restaurants organs coloured stuffs queer names people looking out of upper windows it dwells remote from the british body politic <\s>
<s> yet has it haphazard proprietary instincts of its own and a certain possessive prosperity which keeps its rents up when those of other quarters go down <\s>
<s> for long years soames acquaintanceship with soho had been confined to its western bastion wardour street <\s>
<s> many bargains had he picked up there <\s>
<s> even during those seven years at brighton after bosinney's death and irene's flight he had bought treasures there sometimes though he had no place to put them for when the conviction that his wife had gone for good at last became firm within him he had caused a board to be put up in montpellier square for sale the lease of this desirable residence enquire of messrs <\s>
<s> lesson and tukes court street belgravia <\s>
<s> it had sold within a week that desirable residence in the shadow of whose perfection a man and a woman had eaten their hearts out <\s>
<s> of a misty january evening just before the board was taken down soames had gone there once more and stood against the square railings looking at its unlighted windows chewing the cud of possessive memories which had turned so bitter in the mouth <\s>
<s> why had she never loved him <\s>
<s> she had been given all she had wanted and in return had given him for three long years all he had wanted except indeed her heart <\s>
<s> he had uttered a little involuntary groan and a passing policeman had glanced suspiciously at him who no longer possessed the right to enter that green door with the carved brass knocker beneath the board for sale <\s>
<s> a choking sensation had attacked his throat and he had hurried away into the mist <\s>
<s> that evening he had gone to brighton to live .... <\s>
<s> approaching malta street soho and the restaurant bretagne where annette would be drooping her pretty shoulders over her accounts soames thought with wonder of those seven years at brighton <\s>
<s> how had he managed to go on so long in that town devoid of the scent of sweetpeas where he had not even space to put his treasures <\s>
<s> true those had been years with no time at all for looking at them years of almost passionate money making during which forsyte bustard and forsyte had become solicitors to more limited companies than they could properly attend to <\s>
<s> up to the city of a morning in a pullman car down from the city of an evening in a pullman car <\s>
<s> law papers again after dinner then the sleep of the tired and up again next morning <\s>
<s> saturday to monday was spent at his club in town curious reversal of customary procedure based on the deep and careful instinct that while working so hard he needed sea air to and from the station twice a day and while resting must indulge his domestic affections <\s>
<s> the sunday visit to his family in park lane to timothy's and to green street the occasional visits elsewhere had seemed to him as necessary to health as sea air on weekdays <\s>
<s> even since his migration to mapledurham he had maintained those habits until he had known annette <\s>
<s> whether annette had produced the revolution in his outlook or that outlook had produced annette he knew no more than we know where a circle begins <\s>
<s> it was intricate and deeply involved with the growing consciousness that property without anyone to leave it to is the negation of true forsyteism <\s>
<s> to have an heir some continuance of self who would begin where he left off ensure in fact that he would not leave off had quite obsessed him for the last year and more <\s>
<s> after buying a bit of wedgwood one evening in april he had dropped into malta street to look at a house of his father's which had been turned into a restaurant a risky proceeding and one not quite in accordance with the terms of the lease <\s>
<s> he had stared for a little at the outside painted a good cream colour with two peacock blue tubs containing little bay trees in a recessed doorway and at the words restaurant bretagne above them in gold letters rather favourably impressed <\s>
<s> entering he had noticed that several people were already seated at little round green tables with little pots of fresh flowers on them and brittany ware plates and had asked of a trim waitress to see the proprietor <\s>
<s> they had shown him into a back room where a girl was sitting at a simple bureau covered with papers and a small round table was laid for two <\s>
<s> the impression of cleanliness order and good taste was confirmed when the girl got up saying you wish to see maman monsieur <\s>
<s> in a broken accent <\s>
<s> yes soames had answered i represent your landlord in fact i'm his son <\s>
<s> won't you sit down sir please <\s>
<s> tell maman to come to this gentleman <\s>
<s> he was pleased that the girl seemed impressed because it showed business instinct and suddenly he noticed that she was remarkably pretty so remarkably pretty that his eyes found a difficulty in leaving her face <\s>
<s> when she moved to put a chair for him she swayed in a curious subtle way as if she had been put together by someone with a special secret skill and her face and neck which was a little bared looked as fresh as if they had been sprayed with dew <\s>
<s> probably at this moment soames decided that the lease had not been violated though to himself and his father he based the decision on the efficiency of those illicit adaptations in the building on the signs of prosperity and the obvious business capacity of madame lamotte <\s>
<s> he did not however neglect to leave certain matters to future consideration which had necessitated further visits so that the little back room had become quite accustomed to his spare not unsolid but unobtrusive figure and his pale chinny face with clipped moustache and dark hair not yet grizzling at the sides <\s>
<s> un monsieur tres distingue madame lamotte found him and presently tres amical tres gentil watching his eyes upon her daughter <\s>
<s> she was one of those generously built fine faced dark haired frenchwomen whose every action and tone of voice inspire perfect confidence in the thoroughness of their domestic tastes their knowledge of cooking and the careful increase of their bank balances <\s>
<s> after those visits to the restaurant bretagne began other visits ceased without indeed any definite decision for soames like all forsytes and the great majority of their countrymen was a born empiricist <\s>
<s> but it was this change in his mode of life which had gradually made him so definitely conscious that he desired to alter his condition from that of the unmarried married man to that of the married man remarried <\s>
<s> turning into malta street on this evening of early october 1899 he bought a paper to see if there were any after development of the dreyfus case a question which he had always found useful in making closer acquaintanceship with madame lamotte and her daughter who were catholic and anti dreyfusard <\s>
<s> scanning those columns soames found nothing french but noticed a general fall on the stock exchange and an ominous leader about the transvaal <\s>
<s> he entered thinking war's a certainty <\s>
<s> i shall sell my consols <\s>
<s> not that he had many personally the rate of interest was too wretched but he should advise his companies consols would assuredly go down <\s>
<s> a look as he passed the doorways of the restaurant assured him that business was good as ever and this which in april would have pleased him now gave him a certain uneasiness <\s>
<s> if the steps which he had to take ended in his marrying annette he would rather see her mother safely back in france a move to which the prosperity of the restaurant bretagne might become an obstacle <\s>
