<s> he sat opposite her at dinner and it was terrible impossible to say anything for fear of saying the wrong thing impossible to keep his eyes fixed on her in the only natural way in sum impossible to treat normally one with whom in fancy he had already been over the hills and far away conscious too all the time that he must seem to her to all of them a dumb gawk <\s>
<s> yes it was terrible <\s>
<s> and she was talking so well swooping with swift wing this way and that <\s>
<s> wonderful how she had learned an art which he found so disgustingly difficult <\s>

<s> in just that swift moment of free vision after such intense discomfort jon saw her sublimated as one sees in the dark a slender white fruit tree caught her like a verse of poetry flashed before the eyes of the mind or a tune which floats out in the distance and dies <\s>
<s> he wondered giddily how old she was she seemed so much more self possessed and experienced than himself <\s>

<s> alone with val after dinner he sipped port deferentially and answered the advances of this new found brother in law <\s>
<s> wishes father thought but they don't breed evidence <\s>
<s> holly had pressed her lips again to his forehead with the feeling that it confirmed his theory that all matter was becoming spirit his brow felt somehow so insubstantial <\s>
<s> but the most poignant memory of that little visit had been watching unobserved her stepmother reading to herself a letter from jon <\s>
<s> it was she decided the prettiest sight she had ever seen <\s>
<s> irene lost as it were in the letter of her boy stood at a window where the light fell on her face and her fine grey hair her lips were moving smiling her dark eyes laughing dancing and the hand which did not hold the letter was pressed against her breast <\s>
<s> holly withdrew as from a vision of perfect love convinced that jon must be nice <\s>
<s> when she saw him coming out of the station with a kit bag in either hand she was confirmed in her predisposition <\s>
<s> he was a little like jolly that long lost idol of her childhood but eager looking and less formal with deeper eyes and brighter coloured hair for he wore no hat altogether a very interesting little brother <\s>
<s> his tentative politeness charmed one who was accustomed to assurance in the youthful manner he was disturbed because she was to drive him home instead of his driving her <\s>
<s> shouldn't he have a shot <\s>
<s> they hadn't a car at robin hill since the war of course and he had only driven once and landed up a bank so she oughtn't to mind his trying <\s>
<s> his laugh soft and infectious was very attractive though that word she had heard was now quite old fashioned <\s>
<s> when they reached the house he pulled out a crumpled letter which she read while he was washing a quite short letter which must have cost her father many a pang to write <\s>
<s> my dear you and val will not forget i trust that jon knows nothing of family history <\s>
<s> his mother and i think he is too young at present <\s>
<s> the boy is very dear and the apple of her eye <\s>
<s> verbum sapientibus your loving father j <\s>
<s> that was all but it renewed in holly an uneasy regret that fleur was coming <\s>
<s> after tea she fulfilled that promise to herself and took jon up the hill <\s>
<s> they had a long talk sitting above an old chalk pit grown over with brambles and goosepenny <\s>
<s> milkwort and liverwort starred the green slope the larks sang and thrushes in the brake and now and then a gull flighting inland would wheel very white against the paling sky where the vague moon was coming up <\s>
<s> delicious fragrance came to them as if little invisible creatures were running and treading scent out of the blades of grass <\s>
<s> jon who had fallen silent said rather suddenly i say this is wonderful <\s>
<s> there's no fat on it at all <\s>
<s> gull's flight and sheep bells <\s>
<s> gull's flight and sheep bells <\s>
<s> you're a poet my dear <\s>
<s> i used to at your age <\s>
<s> mother says try too but i'm so rotten <\s>
<s> have you any of yours for me to see <\s>
<s> my dear holly murmured i've been married nineteen years <\s>
<s> i only wrote verses when i wanted to be <\s>
<s> said jon and turned over on his face the one cheek she could see was a charming colour <\s>
<s> was jon touched in the wind then as val would have called it <\s>
<s> but if so all the better he would take no notice of young fleur <\s>
<s> besides on monday he would begin his farming <\s>
<s> was it burns who followed the plough or only piers plowman <\s>
<s> nearly every young man and most young women seemed to be poets now judging from the number of their books she had read out in south africa importing them from hatchus and bumphards and quite good oh <\s>
<s> quite much better than she had been herself <\s>
<s> but then poetry had only really come in since her day with motor cars <\s>
<s> another long talk after dinner over a wood fire in the low hall and there seemed little left to know about jon except anything of real importance <\s>
<s> holly parted from him at his bedroom door having seen twice over that he had everything with the conviction that she would love him and val would like him <\s>
<s> he was eager but did not gush he was a splendid listener sympathetic reticent about himself <\s>
<s> he evidently loved their father and adored his mother <\s>
<s> he liked riding rowing and fencing better than games <\s>
<s> he saved moths from candles and couldn't bear spiders but put them out of doors in screws of paper sooner than kill them <\s>
<s> in a word he was amiable <\s>
<s> she went to sleep thinking that he would suffer horribly if anybody hurt him but who would hurt him <\s>
