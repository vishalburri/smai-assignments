<s> i'll take steps to know where i am he thought i'll go to polteed's the first thing tomorrow morning <\s>
<s> but even in forming that resolution he knew he would have trouble with himself <\s>
<s> he had employed polteed's agency several times in the routine of his profession even quite lately over dartie's case but he had never thought it possible to employ them to watch his own wife <\s>
<s> it was too insulting to himself <\s>
