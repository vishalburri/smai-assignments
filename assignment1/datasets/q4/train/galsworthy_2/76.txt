<s> he threw the fag end of his cigarette at a pigeon with the thought i can't stay here for ever twiddling my thumbs <\s>
<s> better give it up and call on her in the late afternoon <\s>
<s> but he still sat on heard twelve strike and then half past <\s>
<s> i'll wait till one he thought while i'm about it <\s>
<s> but just then he started up and shrinkingly sat down again <\s>
<s> a woman had come out in a cream coloured frock and was moving away under a fawn coloured parasol <\s>
<s> he waited till she was too far away to recognise him then set out after her <\s>
<s> she was strolling as though she had no particular objective moving if he remembered rightly toward the bois de boulogne <\s>
<s> for half an hour at least he kept his distance on the far side of the way till she had passed into the bois itself <\s>
<s> was she going to meet someone after all <\s>
<s> some confounded frenchman one of those bel ami chaps perhaps who had nothing to do but hang about women for he had read that book with difficulty and a sort of disgusted fascination <\s>
<s> he followed doggedly along a shady alley losing sight of her now and then when the path curved <\s>
<s> and it came back to him how long ago one night in hyde park he had slid and sneaked from tree to tree from seat to seat hunting blindly ridiculously in burning jealousy for her and young bosinney <\s>
<s> the path bent sharply and hurrying he came on her sitting in front of a small fountain a little green bronze niobe veiled in hair to her slender hips gazing at the pool she had wept he came on her so suddenly that he was past before he could turn and take off his hat <\s>
<s> she did not start up <\s>
<s> she had always had great self command it was one of the things he most admired in her one of his greatest grievances against her because he had never been able to tell what she was thinking <\s>
<s> had she realised that he was following <\s>
<s> her self possession made him angry and disdaining to explain his presence he pointed to the mournful little niobe and said that's rather a good thing <\s>
<s> he could see then that she was struggling to preserve her composure <\s>
<s> i didn't want to startle you is this one of your haunts <\s>
<s> as he spoke a lady strolling by paused to look at the fountain and passed on <\s>
<s> irene's eyes followed her <\s>
<s> no she said prodding the ground with her parasol never lonely <\s>
<s> one has always one's shadow <\s>
<s> soames understood and looking at her hard he exclaimed well it's your own fault <\s>
<s> you can be free of it at any moment <\s>
<s> irene come back to me and be free <\s>
<s> cried soames stamping his foot it's inhuman <\s>
<s> is there any condition i can make which will bring you back to me <\s>
<s> if i promise you a separate house and just a visit now and then <\s>
<s> irene rose something wild suddenly in her face and figure <\s>
<s> you may hunt me to the grave <\s>
<s> i will not come <\s>
<s> outraged and on edge soames recoiled <\s>
<s> don't make a scene <\s>
<s> and they both stood motionless staring at the little niobe whose greenish flesh the sunlight was burnishing <\s>
<s> that's your last word then muttered soames clenching his hands you condemn us both <\s>
<s> irene bent her head <\s>
<s> i can't come back <\s>
<s> a feeling of monstrous injustice flared up in soames <\s>
<s> he said and listen to me a moment <\s>
<s> you gave me a sacred vow you came to me without a penny <\s>
<s> you had all i could give you <\s>
<s> you broke that vow without cause you made me a by word you refused me a child you've left me in prison you you still move me so that i want you i want you <\s>
<s> well what do you think of yourself <\s>
<s> irene turned her face was deadly pale her eyes burning dark <\s>
<s> god made me as i am she said wicked if you like but not so wicked that i'll give myself again to a man i hate <\s>
<s> the sunlight gleamed on her hair as she moved away and seemed to lay a caress all down her clinging cream coloured frock <\s>
<s> soames could neither speak nor move <\s>
<s> that word hate' so extreme so primitive made all the forsyte in him tremble <\s>
<s> with a deep imprecation he strode away from where she had vanished and ran almost into the arms of the lady sauntering back the fool the shadowing fool <\s>
<s> he was soon dripping with perspiration in the depths of the bois <\s>
<s> well he thought i need have no consideration for her now she has not a grain of it for me <\s>
<s> i'll show her this very day that she's my wife still <\s>
<s> but on the way home to his hotel he was forced to the conclusion that he did not know what he meant <\s>
<s> one could not make scenes in public and short of scenes in public what was there he could do <\s>
<s> he almost cursed his own thin skinnedness <\s>
<s> she might deserve no consideration but he alas <\s>
<s> deserved some at his own hands <\s>
<s> and sitting lunchless in the hall of his hotel with tourists passing every moment baedeker in hand he was visited by black dejection <\s>
<s> his whole life with every natural instinct and every decent yearning gagged and fettered and all because fate had driven him seventeen years ago to set his heart upon this woman so utterly that even now he had no real heart to set on any other <\s>
<s> cursed was the day he had met her and his eyes for seeing in her anything but the cruel venus she was <\s>
<s> and yet still seeing her with the sunlight on the clinging china crepe of her gown he uttered a little groan so that a tourist who was passing thought man in pain <\s>
<s> what did i have for lunch <\s>
<s> later in front of a cafe near the opera over a glass of cold tea with lemon and a straw in it he took the malicious resolution to go and dine at her hotel <\s>
<s> if she were there he would speak to her if she were not he would leave a note <\s>
<s> he dressed carefully and wrote as follows your idyll with that fellow jolyon forsyte is known to me at all events <\s>
<s> if you pursue it understand that i will leave no stone unturned to make things unbearable for him <\s>
<s> f he sealed this note but did not address it refusing to write the maiden name which she had impudently resumed or to put the word forsyte on the envelope lest she should tear it up unread <\s>
<s> then he went out and made his way through the glowing streets abandoned to evening pleasure seekers <\s>
<s> entering her hotel he took his seat in a far corner of the dining room whence he could see all entrances and exits <\s>
<s> she was not there <\s>
<s> he ate little quickly watchfully <\s>
<s> she did not come <\s>
<s> he lingered in the lounge over his coffee drank two liqueurs of brandy <\s>
<s> but still she did not come <\s>
<s> he went over to the keyboard and examined the names <\s>
<s> number twelve on the first floor <\s>
<s> and he determined to take the note up himself <\s>
<s> he mounted red carpeted stairs past a little salon eight ten twelve <\s>
