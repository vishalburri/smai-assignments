<s> to forsyte eyes bosinney appeared to have no habitat he seemed one of those rare and unfortunate men who go through life surrounded by circumstance property acquaintances and wives that do not belong to them <\s>
<s> his rooms in sloane street on the top floor outside which on a plate was his name philip baynes bosinney architect were not those of a forsyte he had no sitting room apart from his office but a large recess had been screened off to conceal the necessaries of life a couch an easy chair his pipes spirit case novels and slippers <\s>

<s> he would say always spoke of his three eldest boys as good creatures but so dull they're all doing capitally in the indian civil <\s>
<s> philip was the only one he liked <\s>
<s> i've heard him talk in the queerest way he once said to me my dear fellow never let your poor wife know what you're thinking of <\s>
<s> but i didn't follow his advice not i <\s>
<s> he would say to phil whether you live like a gentleman or not my boy be sure you die like one <\s>
<s> and he had himself embalmed in a frock coat suit with a satin cravat and a diamond pin <\s>
<s> oh quite an original i can assure you <\s>
<s> of bosinney himself baynes would speak warmly with a certain compassion he's got a streak of his father's byronism <\s>
