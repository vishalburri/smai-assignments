<s> he had not felt so well for weeks <\s>
<s> puffing out his lower lip he gave his last instructions adolf the least touch of the west india when you come to the ham <\s>
<s> passing into the anteroom he sat down on the edge of a chair with his knees apart and his tall bulky form was wrapped at once in an expectant strange primeval immobility <\s>
<s> he was ready to rise at a moment's notice <\s>
<s> he had not given a dinner party for months <\s>
<s> this dinner in honour of june's engagement had seemed a bore at first among forsytes the custom of solemnizing engagements by feasts was religiously observed but the labours of sending invitations and ordering the repast over he felt pleasantly stimulated <\s>
<s> and thus sitting a watch in his hand fat and smooth and golden like a flattened globe of butter he thought of nothing <\s>
<s> a long man with side whiskers who had once been in swithin's service but was now a greengrocer entered and proclaimed mrs <\s>
<s> the one in front habited entirely in red had large settled patches of the same colour in her cheeks and a hard dashing eye <\s>
<s> she walked at swithin holding out a hand cased in a long primrose coloured glove well <\s>
<s> swithin she said i haven't seen you for ages <\s>
<s> why my dear boy how stout you're getting <\s>
<s> the fixity of swithin's eye alone betrayed emotion <\s>
<s> a dumb and grumbling anger swelled his bosom <\s>
<s> it was vulgar to be stout to talk of being stout he had a chest nothing more <\s>
<s> turning to his sister he grasped her hand and said in a tone of command well juley <\s>
<s> septimus small was the tallest of the four sisters her good round old face had gone a little sour an innumerable pout clung all over it as if it had been encased in an iron wire mask up to that evening which being suddenly removed left little rolls of mutinous flesh all over her countenance <\s>
<s> even her eyes were pouting <\s>
<s> it was thus that she recorded her permanent resentment at the loss of septimus small <\s>
<s> she had quite a reputation for saying the wrong thing and tenacious like all her breed she would hold to it when she had said it and add to it another wrong thing and so on <\s>
<s> with the decease of her husband the family tenacity the family matter of factness had gone sterile within her <\s>
<s> a great talker when allowed she would converse without the faintest animation for hours together relating with epic monotony the innumerable occasions on which fortune had misused her nor did she ever perceive that her hearers sympathized with fortune for her heart was kind <\s>
<s> having sat poor soul long by the bedside of small a man of poor constitution she had acquired the habit and there were countless subsequent occasions when she had sat immense periods of time to amuse sick people children and other helpless persons and she could never divest herself of the feeling that the world was the most ungrateful place anybody could live in <\s>
<s> sunday after sunday she sat at the feet of that extremely witty preacher the rev <\s>
<s> thomas scoles who exercised a great influence over her but she succeeded in convincing everybody that even this was a misfortune <\s>
<s> she had passed into a proverb in the family and when anybody was observed to be peculiarly distressing he was known as a regular juley <\s>
<s> the habit of her mind would have killed anybody but a forsyte at forty but she was seventy two and had never looked better <\s>
<s> and one felt that there were capacities for enjoyment about her which might yet come out <\s>
<s> she owned three canaries the cat tommy and half a parrot in common with her sister hester and these poor creatures kept carefully out of timothy's way he was nervous about animals unlike human beings recognising that she could not help being blighted attached themselves to her passionately <\s>
<s> she was sombrely magnificent this evening in black bombazine with a mauve front cut in a shy triangle and crowned with a black velvet ribbon round the base of her thin throat black and mauve for evening wear was esteemed very chaste by nearly every forsyte <\s>
<s> pouting at swithin she said ann has been asking for you <\s>
<s> you haven't been near us for an age <\s>
<s> swithin put his thumbs within the armholes of his waistcoat and replied ann's getting very shaky she ought to have a doctor <\s>
<s> nicholas forsyte cocking his rectangular eyebrows wore a smile <\s>
<s> he had succeeded during the day in bringing to fruition a scheme for the employment of a tribe from upper india in the gold mines of ceylon <\s>
<s> a pet plan carried at last in the teeth of great difficulties he was justly pleased <\s>
<s> it would double the output of his mines and as he had often forcibly argued all experience tended to show that a man must die and whether he died of a miserable old age in his own country or prematurely of damp in the bottom of a foreign mine was surely of little consequence provided that by a change in his mode of life he benefited the british empire <\s>
<s> his ability was undoubted <\s>
<s> raising his broken nose towards his listener he would add for want of a few hundred of these fellows we haven't paid a dividend for years and look at the price of the shares <\s>
<s> i can't get ten shillings for them <\s>
<s> he had been at yarmouth too and had come back feeling that he had added at least ten years to his own life <\s>
<s> he grasped swithin's hand exclaiming in a jocular voice well so here we are again <\s>
<s> nicholas an effete woman smiled a smile of frightened jollity behind his back <\s>
<s> swithin drew his heels together his deportment ever admirable <\s>
<s> well james well emily <\s>
<s> how are you soames <\s>
<s> how do you do <\s>
<s> his hand enclosed irene's and his eyes swelled <\s>
<s> she was a pretty woman a little too pale but her figure her eyes her teeth <\s>
<s> too good for that chap soames <\s>
<s> the gods had given irene dark brown eyes and golden hair that strange combination provocative of men's glances which is said to be the mark of a weak character <\s>
<s> and the full soft pallor of her neck and shoulders above a gold coloured frock gave to her personality an alluring strangeness <\s>
<s> soames stood behind his eyes fastened on his wife's neck <\s>
<s> the hands of swithin's watch which he still held open in his hand had left eight behind it was half an hour beyond his dinner time he had had no lunch and a strange primeval impatience surged up within him <\s>
<s> it's not like jolyon to be late <\s>
<s> he said to irene with uncontrollable vexation <\s>
<s> i suppose it'll be june keeping him <\s>
<s> people in love are always late she answered <\s>
<s> swithin stared at her a dusky orange dyed his cheeks <\s>
<s> they've no business to be <\s>
<s> and behind this outburst the inarticulate violence of primitive generations seemed to mutter and grumble <\s>
<s> tell me what you think of my new star uncle swithin said irene softly <\s>
<s> among the lace in the bosom of her dress was shining a five pointed star made of eleven diamonds <\s>
<s> swithin looked at the star <\s>
<s> he had a pretty taste in stones no question could have been more sympathetically devised to distract his attention <\s>
<s> who gave you that <\s>
<s> there was no change in her face but swithin's pale eyes bulged as though he might suddenly have been afflicted with insight <\s>
<s> i dare say you're dull at home he said <\s>
<s> any day you like to come and dine with me i'll give you as good a bottle of wine as you'll get in london <\s>
<s> swithin moved his arm and said in a rumbling voice dinner now dinner <\s>
<s> he took in irene on the ground that he had not entertained her since she was a bride <\s>
<s> june was the portion of bosinney who was placed between irene and his fiancee <\s>
<s> on the other side of june was james with mrs <\s>
<s> nicholas then old jolyon with mrs <\s>
<s> james nicholas with hatty chessman soames with mrs <\s>
<s> small completing the circle to swithin again <\s>
<s> family dinners of the forsytes observe certain traditions <\s>
<s> there are for instance no hors d'oeuvre <\s>
<s> the reason for this is unknown <\s>
<s> theory among the younger members traces it to the disgraceful price of oysters it is more probably due to a desire to come to the point to a good practical sense deciding at once that hors d'oeuvre are but poor things <\s>
<s> the jameses alone unable to withstand a custom almost universal in park lane are now and then unfaithful <\s>
