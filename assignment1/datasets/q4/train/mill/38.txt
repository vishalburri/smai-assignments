<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>

<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>

<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>
<s> many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated property tax viz an income tax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income <\s>
<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first <\s>
<s> the mode of adjusting these inequalities of pressure which seems to be the most equitable is that recommended by bentham of leaving a certain minimum of income sufficient to provide the necessaries of life untaxed <\s>
<s> suppose 250 a year to be sufficient to provide the number of persons ordinarily supported from a single income with the requisites of life and health and with protection against habitual bodily suffering but not with any indulgence <\s>
<s> this then should be made the minimum and incomes exceeding it should pay taxes not upon their whole amount but upon the surplus <\s>
<s> if the tax be ten per cent an income of 300 should be considered as a net income of 50 and charged with 5 a year while an income of 5,000 should be charged as one of 4,750 <\s>
<s> an income not exceeding 250 should not be taxed at all either directly or by taxes on necessaries for as by supposition this is the smallest income which labor ought to be able to command the government ought not to be a party to making it smaller <\s>
<s> both in england and on the continent a graduated property tax l   impt progressif has been advocated on the avowed ground that the state should use the instrument of taxation as a means of mitigating the inequalities of wealth <\s>
<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>
<s> it is not the fortunes which are earned but those which are unearned that it is for the public good to place under limitation <\s>
<s> with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested 337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance <\s>
<s> i conceive that inheritances and legacies exceeding a certain amount are highly proper subjects for taxation and that the revenue from them should be as great as it can be made without giving rise to evasions by donation inter vivos or concealment of property such as it would be impossible adequately to check <\s>
<s> the principle of graduation as it is called that is of levying a larger percentage on a larger sum though its application to general taxation would be in my opinion objectionable seems to me both just and expedient as applied to legacy and inheritance duties <\s>
<s> the objection to a graduated property tax applies in an aggravated degree to the proposition of an exclusive tax on what is called    realized property    that is property not forming a part of any capital engaged in business or rather in business under the superintendence of the owner as land the public funds money lent on mortgage and shares in stock companies <\s>

<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>

<s> suppose 250 a year to be sufficient to provide the number of persons ordinarily supported from a single income with the requisites of life and health and with protection against habitual bodily suffering but not with any indulgence <\s>
<s> this then should be made the minimum and incomes exceeding it should pay taxes not upon their whole amount but upon the surplus <\s>
<s> if the tax be ten per cent an income of 300 should be considered as a net income of 50 and charged with 5 a year while an income of 5,000 should be charged as one of 4,750 <\s>
<s> an income not exceeding 250 should not be taxed at all either directly or by taxes on necessaries for as by supposition this is the smallest income which labor ought to be able to command the government ought not to be a party to making it smaller <\s>

<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>

<s> we shall first consider the economical effects arising from the manner in which governments perform their necessary and acknowledged functions <\s>
<s> we shall then pass to certain governmental interferences of what i have termed the optional kind i e overstepping the boundaries of the universally acknowledged functions which have heretofore taken place and in some cases still take place under the influence of false general theories <\s>
<s> the first of these divisions is of an extremely miscellaneous character since the necessary functions of government and those which are so manifestly expedient that they have never or very rarely been objected to are too various to be brought under any very simple classification <\s>
<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>
<s>    2 <\s>
<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>
<s> an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling <\s>
<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>
<s> many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated property tax viz an income tax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income <\s>
<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first <\s>

<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>

<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>
<s>    2 <\s>
<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>
<s> an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling <\s>
<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>

<s> we shall first consider the economical effects arising from the manner in which governments perform their necessary and acknowledged functions <\s>

<s> the first of these divisions is of an extremely miscellaneous character since the necessary functions of government and those which are so manifestly expedient that they have never or very rarely been objected to are too various to be brought under any very simple classification <\s>
<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>
<s>    2 <\s>
<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>
<s> an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling <\s>
<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>

<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>

<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>

<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>
<s> many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated property tax viz an income tax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income <\s>
<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>

<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>
<s> it is not the fortunes which are earned but those which are unearned that it is for the public good to place under limitation <\s>
<s> with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested 337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance <\s>

<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>

<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>

<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>

<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>

<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>

<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>

<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>

<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>

<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>
<s> many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated property tax viz an income tax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income <\s>
<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first <\s>
<s> the mode of adjusting these inequalities of pressure which seems to be the most equitable is that recommended by bentham of leaving a certain minimum of income sufficient to provide the necessaries of life untaxed <\s>
<s> suppose 250 a year to be sufficient to provide the number of persons ordinarily supported from a single income with the requisites of life and health and with protection against habitual bodily suffering but not with any indulgence <\s>
<s> this then should be made the minimum and incomes exceeding it should pay taxes not upon their whole amount but upon the surplus <\s>
<s> if the tax be ten per cent an income of 300 should be considered as a net income of 50 and charged with 5 a year while an income of 5,000 should be charged as one of 4,750 <\s>

<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>
<s> it is not the fortunes which are earned but those which are unearned that it is for the public good to place under limitation <\s>
<s> with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested 337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance <\s>

<s> if any subscriber was too poor to pay 50 for a share the subsequent dividends and payments were to be applied to purchasing the share <\s>
<s> after reserving a fair allowance for expenses like the redemption of capital whenever the remaining profits exceeded ten per cent on the capital that excess was to be divided into two equal parts one of which was to be distributed among all persons employed by the company in proportion to their wages and the other was to be retained by the capital <\s>

<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>

<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>
<s> it is not the fortunes which are earned but those which are unearned that it is for the public good to place under limitation <\s>
<s> with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested 337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance <\s>

<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>

<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>

<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>

<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>

<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first <\s>

<s> we shall first consider the economical effects arising from the manner in which governments perform their necessary and acknowledged functions <\s>

<s> the first of these divisions is of an extremely miscellaneous character since the necessary functions of government and those which are so manifestly expedient that they have never or very rarely been objected to are too various to be brought under any very simple classification <\s>
<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>
<s>    2 <\s>
<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>
<s> an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling <\s>
<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>

<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>

<s> we shall first consider the economical effects arising from the manner in which governments perform their necessary and acknowledged functions <\s>
<s> we shall then pass to certain governmental interferences of what i have termed the optional kind i e overstepping the boundaries of the universally acknowledged functions which have heretofore taken place and in some cases still take place under the influence of false general theories <\s>
<s> the first of these divisions is of an extremely miscellaneous character since the necessary functions of government and those which are so manifestly expedient that they have never or very rarely been objected to are too various to be brought under any very simple classification <\s>
<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>
<s>    2 <\s>
<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>
<s> an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling <\s>
<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>

<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>

<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>

<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>

<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first <\s>

<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>

<s> with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested 337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>

<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>

<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>

<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>

<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>

<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>

<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>
<s> many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated property tax viz an income tax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income <\s>
<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>

<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>
<s> it is not the fortunes which are earned but those which are unearned that it is for the public good to place under limitation <\s>
<s> with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested 337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance <\s>

<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>

<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>

<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>

<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first <\s>

<s> this then should be made the minimum and incomes exceeding it should pay taxes not upon their whole amount but upon the surplus <\s>
<s> if the tax be ten per cent an income of 300 should be considered as a net income of 50 and charged with 5 a year while an income of 5,000 should be charged as one of 4,750 <\s>

<s> we shall first consider the economical effects arising from the manner in which governments perform their necessary and acknowledged functions <\s>
<s> we shall then pass to certain governmental interferences of what i have termed the optional kind i e overstepping the boundaries of the universally acknowledged functions which have heretofore taken place and in some cases still take place under the influence of false general theories <\s>
<s> the first of these divisions is of an extremely miscellaneous character since the necessary functions of government and those which are so manifestly expedient that they have never or very rarely been objected to are too various to be brought under any very simple classification <\s>
<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>
<s>    2 <\s>
<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>
<s> an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling <\s>
<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>
<s> many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated property tax viz an income tax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income <\s>

<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>

<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>
<s> he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods <\s>
<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>
<s>    4 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people    secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment <\s>
<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>

<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>

<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>

<s> we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation <\s>
<s> the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them :( 336    1 <\s>
<s> the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state <\s>
<s> in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation <\s>
<s>    2 <\s>
<s> the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary <\s>
<s> the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person <\s>
<s> the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty <\s>
<s>    3 <\s>
<s> every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it <\s>
<s> taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him <\s>

<s> as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes <\s>

<s>    thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals <\s>
<s> an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling <\s>
<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>

<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>

<s> fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax gatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression    to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes <\s>
<s> grounds of the principle of equality of taxation <\s>
<s> the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind <\s>
<s> for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation <\s>
<s> for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government <\s>
<s> a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it <\s>
<s> if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share <\s>
<s> equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice <\s>
<s> it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his <\s>
<s> there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it <\s>
<s> since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybodys person receiving the same amount of protection a poll tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property <\s>
<s> but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government <\s>
<s> in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions <\s>
<s> it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected <\s>
<s> if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income <\s>
<s> setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means <\s>
<s> many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated property tax viz an income tax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income <\s>
<s> on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first <\s>
<s> the mode of adjusting these inequalities of pressure which seems to be the most equitable is that recommended by bentham of leaving a certain minimum of income sufficient to provide the necessaries of life untaxed <\s>
<s> suppose 250 a year to be sufficient to provide the number of persons ordinarily supported from a single income with the requisites of life and health and with protection against habitual bodily suffering but not with any indulgence <\s>
<s> this then should be made the minimum and incomes exceeding it should pay taxes not upon their whole amount but upon the surplus <\s>
<s> if the tax be ten per cent an income of 300 should be considered as a net income of 50 and charged with 5 a year while an income of 5,000 should be charged as one of 4,750 <\s>
<s> an income not exceeding 250 should not be taxed at all either directly or by taxes on necessaries for as by supposition this is the smallest income which labor ought to be able to command the government ought not to be a party to making it smaller <\s>
<s> both in england and on the continent a graduated property tax l   impt progressif has been advocated on the avowed ground that the state should use the instrument of taxation as a means of mitigating the inequalities of wealth <\s>
<s> i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent <\s>
<s> to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors <\s>
<s> it is not the fortunes which are earned but those which are unearned that it is for the public good to place under limitation <\s>
<s> with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested 337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance <\s>
<s> i conceive that inheritances and legacies exceeding a certain amount are highly proper subjects for taxation and that the revenue from them should be as great as it can be made without giving rise to evasions by donation inter vivos or concealment of property such as it would be impossible adequately to check <\s>
<s> the principle of graduation as it is called that is of levying a larger percentage on a larger sum though its application to general taxation would be in my opinion objectionable seems to me both just and expedient as applied to legacy and inheritance duties <\s>
<s> the objection to a graduated property tax applies in an aggravated degree to the proposition of an exclusive tax on what is called    realized property    that is property not forming a part of any capital engaged in business or rather in business under the superintendence of the owner as land the public funds money lent on mortgage and shares in stock companies <\s>
<s> except the proposal of applying a sponge to the national debt no such palpable violation of common honesty has found sufficient support in this country during the present generation to be regarded as within the domain of discussion <\s>
