<s> very justly cairnes 199 adds also a third condition    the possibility of transferring the possession of the articles which are the subject of the exchange    for instance a cargo of wheat at the bottom of the sea has value in use and difficulty of attainment but it is not transferable <\s>
<s> say maintains that    value depends entirely on utility    if utility means the power to satisfy a desire things which merely have utility and no difficulty of attainment could have no exchange value 200 f <\s>
<s> walker 201 believes that    value depends wholly on the relation between demand and supply    carey 202 holds that value depends merely on the cost of reproduction of the given article <\s>
<s> roscher 203 finds that exchange value is    based on a combination of value in use with cost value    cherbuliez 204 calls the conditions of value two    the ability to give satisfaction and inability of attainment without effort <\s>
<s> the first element is subjective it is determined wholly by the needs or desires of the parties to the exchange <\s>
<s> the second is objective it depends upon material considerations which are the conditions of the existence of the thing and upon which the needs of the persons exchanging have no influence whatever    it is as usual one of cherbuliezs clear expositions <\s>
<s> perry 205 states that    while value always takes its rise in the desires of men it is never realized except through the efforts of men and through these efforts as mutually exchanged    the difficulty of attainment which determines value is not always the same kind of difficulty 1 it sometimes consists in an absolute limitation of the supply <\s>
<s> there are things of which it is physically impossible to increase the quantity beyond certain narrow limits <\s>
<s> such are those wines which can be grown only in peculiar circumstances of soil climate and exposure <\s>
<s> such also are ancient sculptures pictures by the old masters rare books or coins or other articles of antiquarian curiosity <\s>
<s> among such may also be reckoned houses and building ground in a town of definite extent <\s>
<s> de quincey 206 has presented some ingenious diagrams to represent the operations of the two constituents of value in each of the three following cases u represents the power of the article to satisfy some desire and d difficulty of attainment <\s>
<s> in the first case exchange value is not hindered by d from going up to any height and so it rises and falls entirely according to the force of u <\s>
<s> d being practically infinite the horizontal line exchange value is not kept down by d but it rises just as far as u the desires of purchasers may carry it <\s>
<s> illustration vertical line d paralleled by shorter vertical line u d and u connected at top of u by horizontal line 2 but there is another category embracing the majority of all things that are bought and sold in which the obstacle to attainment consists only in the labor and expense requisite to produce the commodity <\s>
<s> without a certain labor and expense it can not be had but when any one is willing to incur these there needs be no limit to the multiplication of the product <\s>
<s> if there were laborers enough and machinery enough cottons woolens or linens might be produced by thousands of yards for every single yard now manufactured <\s>
<s> in case 2 the horizontal line representing exchange value follows the force of d entirely <\s>
<s> the utility of the article is very great but the value is only limited by the difficulty of obtaining it <\s>
<s> so far as u is concerned exchange value can go up a great distance but will go no higher than the point where the article can be obtained <\s>
<s> the dotted lines underneath the horizontal line indicate that the exchange value of articles in this class tend to fall in value <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines u and d u being longer joined by several horizontal lines of exchange value 3 there is a third case intermediate between the two preceding and rather more complex which i shall at present merely indicate but the importance of which in political economy is extremely great <\s>
<s> there are commodities which can be multiplied to an indefinite extent by labor and expenditure but not by a fixed amount of labor and expenditure <\s>
<s> only a limited quantity can be produced at a given cost if more is wanted it must be produced at a greater cost <\s>
<s> to this class as has been often repeated agricultural produce belongs and generally all the rude produce of the earth and this peculiarity is a source of very important consequences one of which is the necessity of a limit to population and another the payment of rent <\s>
<s> in case 3 articles like agricultural produce have a very great power to satisfy desires and if scarce would have a high value <\s>
<s> so far as u is concerned here also as in case 2 exchange value might mount upward to almost any height but it can go no higher than d permits <\s>
<s> in commodities of this class affected by the law of diminishing returns the tendency is for d to increase and so for exchange value to rise as indicated by the dotted lines above that of the exchange value <\s>
<s> illustration same as before   3 <\s>
<s> commodities limited in quantity by the law of demand and supply general working of this law <\s>
<s> these being the three classes in one or other of which all things that are bought and sold must take their place we shall consider them in their order <\s>
<s> and first of things absolutely limited in quantity such as ancient sculptures or pictures <\s>
<s> of such things it is commonly said that their value depends on their scarcity others say that the value depends on the demand and supply <\s>
<s> but this statement requires much explanation <\s>
<s> the supply of a commodity is an intelligible expression it means the quantity offered for sale the quantity that is to be had at a given time and place by those who wish to purchase it <\s>
<s> but what is meant by the demand <\s>
<s> not the mere desire for the commodity <\s>
<s> a beggar may desire a diamond but his desire however great will have no influence on the price <\s>
<s> writers have therefore given a more limited sense to demand and have defined it the wish to possess combined with the power of purchasing 207 to distinguish demand in this technical sense from the demand which is synonymous with desire they call the former effectual demand <\s>
<s> general supply consists in the commodities offered in exchange for other commodities general demand likewise if no money exists consists in the commodities offered as purchasing power in exchange for other commodities <\s>
<s> that is one can not increase the demand for certain things without increasing the supply of some articles which will be received in exchange for the desired commodities <\s>
<s> demand is based upon the production of articles having exchange value in its economic sense and the measure of this demand is necessarily the quantity of commodities offered in exchange for the desired goods <\s>
<s> general demand and supply are thus reciprocal to each other <\s>
<s> but as soon as money or general purchasing power is introduced mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 208 defines    demand as the desire for commodities or services seeking its end by an offer of general purchasing power and supply as the desire for general purchasing power seeking its end by an offer of specific commodities or services    but many persons find a difficulty because they insist upon separating the idea of supply from that of demand owing to the fact that producers seem to be a distinct class in the community different from consumers <\s>
<s> that they are in reality the same persons can be easily explained by the following statement    a certain number of people a b c d e f etc are engaged in industrial occupationsa produces for b c d e f b for a c d e f c for a b d e f and so on <\s>
<s> in each case the producer and the consumers are distinct and hence by a very natural fallacy it is concluded that the whole body of consumers is distinct from the whole body of producers whereas they consist of precisely the same persons    but in regard to demand and supply of particular commodities not general demand and supply the increase of the demand is not necessarily followed by an increased supply or vice versa <\s>
<s> out of the total production which constitutes general demand a varying amount sometimes more sometimes less may be directed by the desires of men to the purchase of some given thing <\s>
<s> this should be borne in mind in connection with the future discussion of over production <\s>
<s> the identity of general demand with general supply shows there can be no general over production but so long as there exists the possibility that the demand for a particular commodity may diminish without a corresponding effect being thereby produced on the supply of that commodity by a necessary connection we see that there may be over production of particular commodities that is a production in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the proper mathematical analogy between demand and supply is that of an equation <\s>
<s> if unequal at any moment competition equalizes them and the manner in which this is done is by an adjustment of the value <\s>
<s> if the demand increases the value rises if the demand diminishes the value falls again if the supply falls off the value rises and falls if the supply is increased <\s>
<s> the rise or the fall continues until the demand and supply are again equal to one another and the value which a commodity will bring in any market is no other than the value which in that market gives a demand just sufficient to carry off the existing or expected supply <\s>
<s> cairnes 209 finally defined market value as the price    which is sufficient and no more than sufficient to carry the existing supply over with such a surplus as circumstances may render advisable to meet the new supplies forthcoming    which is nothing more than a paraphrase of the words    existing or expected supply    just used by mr <\s>
<s> it seems unnecessary therefore that mr <\s>
<s> cairnes should have added    according to mr <\s>
<s> mill the actual market price is the price which equalizes supply and demand in a given market as i view the case the    proper market price    is the price which equalizes supply and demand not as existing in the particular market but in the larger sense which i have assigned to the terms <\s>
<s> to this price the actual market price will according to my view approximate in proportion to the intelligence and knowledge of the dealers    adam smith who introduced the expression    effectual demand    employed it to denote the demand of those who are willing and able to give for the commodity what he calls its natural pricethat is the price which will enable it to be permanently produced and brought to market 210 this then is the law of value with respect to all commodities not susceptible of being multiplied at pleasure <\s>
<s> miscellaneous cases falling under this law <\s>
<s> there are but few commodities which are naturally and necessarily limited in supply <\s>
<s> but any commodity whatever may be artificially so <\s>
