<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>

<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>

<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>

<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>

<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>

<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>
<s> that an increase of the quantity of money raises prices and a diminution lowers them is the most elementary proposition in the theory of currency and without it we should have no key to any of the others <\s>
<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>

<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>

<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>

<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>

<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>

<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>

<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>

<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>

<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>

<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>

<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>

<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>

<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>

<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>

<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>

<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>

<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>

<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>

<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>

<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>

<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>

<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>

<s> the whole of the goods being in any case exchanged for the whole of the money which comes into the market to be laid out they will sell for less or more of it exactly according as less or more is brought <\s>
<s>    together with the rapidity of circulation <\s>
<s> it might be supposed that there is always in circulation in a country a quantity of money equal in value to the whole of the goods then and there on sale <\s>
<s> but this would be a complete misapprehension <\s>
<s> the money laid out is equal in value to the goods it purchases but the quantity of money laid out is not the same thing with the quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> as the money passes from hand to hand the same piece of money is laid out many times before all the things on sale at one time are purchased and finally removed from the market and each pound or dollar must be counted for as many pounds or dollars as the number of times it changes hands in order to effect this object <\s>
<s> if we assume the quantity of goods on sale and the number of times those goods are resold to be fixed quantities the value of money will depend upon its quantity together with the average number of times that each piece changes hands in the process <\s>
<s> the whole of the goods sold counting each resale of the same goods as so much added to the goods have been exchanged for the whole of the money multiplied by the number of purchases made on the average by each piece <\s>
<s> consequently the amount of goods and of transactions being the same the value of money is inversely as its quantity multiplied by what is called the rapidity of circulation <\s>
<s> and the quantity of money in circulation is equal to the money value of all the goods sold divided by the number which expresses the rapidity of circulation <\s>
<s> this may be expressed in mathematical language where v is the value of money q is the quantity in circulation and r the number expressing the rapidity of circulation as follows v 1 q   r <\s>
<s> the phrase rapidity of circulation requires some comment <\s>
<s> it must not be understood to mean the number of purchases made by each piece of money in a given time <\s>
<s> time is not the thing to be considered <\s>
<s> the state of society may be such that each piece of money hardly performs more than one purchase in a year but if this arises from the small number of transactionsfrom the small amount of business done the want of activity in traffic or because what traffic there is mostly takes place by barterit constitutes no reason why prices should be lower or the value of money higher <\s>
<s> the essential point is not how often the same money changes hands in a given time but how often it changes hands in order to perform a given amount of traffic <\s>
<s> we must compare the number of purchases made by the money in a given time not with the time itself but with the goods sold in that same time <\s>
<s> if each piece of money changes hands on an average ten times while goods are sold to the value of a million sterling it is evident that the money required to circulate those goods is   100,000 <\s>
<s> and conversely if the money in circulation is   100,000 and each piece changes hands by the purchase of goods ten times in a month the sales of goods for money which take place every month must amount on the average to   1,000 000 <\s>
<s> the essential point to be considered is the average number of purchases made by each piece in order to affect a given pecuniary amount of transactions <\s>
<s>    there is no doubt that the rapidity of circulation varies very much between one country and another <\s>
<s> a thrifty people with slight banking facilities like the french swiss belgians and dutch hoard coin much more than an improvident people like the english or even a careful people with a perfect banking system like the scotch <\s>
<s> many circumstances too affect the rapidity of circulation <\s>
<s> railways and rapid steamboats enable coin and bullion to be more swiftly remitted than of old telegraphs prevent its needless removal and the acceleration of the mails has a like effect       so different are the commercial habits of different peoples that there evidently exists no proportion whatever between the amount of currency in a country and the aggregate of the exchanges which can be effected by it    229   4 <\s>
<s> explanations and limitations of this principle <\s>
<s> the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which moneythat is gold or silveris the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown <\s>
<s> when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression <\s>
<s> that an increase of the quantity of money raises prices and a diminution lowers them is the most elementary proposition in the theory of currency and without it we should have no key to any of the others <\s>
<s> in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same <\s>
<s> it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow <\s>
<s> but this is by no means an inevitable consequence <\s>
<s> in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value <\s>
<s> whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices <\s>
<s> this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against goods <\s>
<s> it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market <\s>
<s> a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public <\s>
<s> by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price <\s>
<s> as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence <\s>
<s> this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices <\s>
<s> if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices <\s>
<s> for example bankers in eastern cities each year send in the autumn to the west as the crops are gathered very large sums of money to settle transactions in the buying and selling of grain wool etc but it again flows back to the great centers of business in a short time in payment of purchases from eastern merchants <\s>
<s> of the value of money as dependent on cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it <\s>
<s> but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply <\s>
<s> the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production <\s>
<s> we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves <\s>
<s> governments have not always left things to themselves <\s>
<s> it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in <\s>
<s> by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one <\s>
<s> we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom <\s>
<s> in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another <\s>
<s> on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion <\s>
<s> it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn <\s>
<s> this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal <\s>
<s> if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion <\s>
<s> if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction <\s>
<s> the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous <\s>
<s> in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper alloy <\s>
<s> for the trade dollars as was consistent with their being only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at san francisco on the tale value <\s>
<s>    which is determined by the cost of production <\s>
<s> the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state <\s>
<s> to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine <\s>
<s> for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case <\s>
<s> of the three classes into which commodities are dividedthose absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of productionthe precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class <\s>
<s> their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply <\s>
<s> a pound weight of gold will in the gold producing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work <\s>
<s> the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value <\s>
<s> suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures <\s>
<s> a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall <\s>
<s> if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value <\s>
<s> when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost valuethe coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullionmoney will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low <\s>
<s> these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production <\s>
<s> e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment <\s>
<s> in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made <\s>
<s> it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals <\s>
<s> being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers <\s>
<s> even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices <\s>
<s> the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world <\s>
<s> and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a weeks food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained <\s>
<s> for the facts in regard to the production of the precious metals see the investigation by dr <\s>
<s> adolf soetbeer 230 from which chart ix has been taken <\s>
<s> it is worthy of careful study <\s>
<s> the figures in each period at the top of the respective spaces give the average annual production during those years <\s>
<s> the last period has been added by me from figures taken from the reports of the director of the united states mint <\s>
<s> other accessible sources for the production of the precious metals are the tables in the appendices to the report of the committee to the house of commons on the    depreciation of silver    1876 ); the french official procs verbaux of the international monetary conference of 1881 which give soetbeers figures to a later date than his publication above mentioned the various papers in the british parliamentary documents and the reports of the director of our mint <\s>
<s> since 1850 more gold has been produced than in the whole period preceding from 1492 to 1850 <\s>
<s> previous to 1849 the annual average product of gold out of the total product of both gold and silver was thirty six per cent for the twenty six years ending in 1875 it has been seventy and one half per cent <\s>
<s> the result has been a rise in gold prices certainly down to 1862 231 as shown by the following chart <\s>
