<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>
<s> the peasant does not subsist this year on the produce of this years harvest but on that of the last <\s>
<s> the artisan is not living on the proceeds of the work he has in hand but on those of work previously executed and disposed of <\s>

<s> the large capitalist is in like manner maintained from funds provided in advance <\s>
<s> examination of cases illustrative of the idea of capital <\s>
<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>
<s> from this can be seen the enormous waste of wealth to the united states during the war and consequently the less existing capital to day in this country since under the same inducements to save the smaller the outside circle wealth the less the inside circle capital must be <\s>

<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>

<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>

<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>

<s> examination of cases illustrative of the idea of capital <\s>
<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>

<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>

<s> precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>

<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> fundamental propositions respecting capital <\s>

<s> to employ labor in a manufacture is to invest capital in the manufacture <\s>

<s> another part he has in the form of machinery <\s>
<s> a third consists if he be a spinner of raw cotton flax or wool if a weaver of flaxen woolen silk or cotton thread and the like according to the nature of the manufacture <\s>
<s> food and clothing for his operatives it is not the custom of the present age that he should directly provide and few capitalists except the producers of food or clothing have any portion worth mentioning of their capital in that shape <\s>
<s> instead of this each capitalist has money which he pays to his work people and so enables them to supply themselves <\s>
<s> what then is his capital <\s>
<s> precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>

<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>

<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>

<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>

<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> examination of cases illustrative of the idea of capital <\s>
<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>

<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>

<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>

<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>

<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>

<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>

<s> to employ labor in a manufacture is to invest capital in the manufacture <\s>

<s> the proposition indeed must be assented to as soon as it is distinctly apprehended <\s>

<s> roschers definition is    every product laid by for purposes of further production       political economy    section 42 by some labor is regarded as capital 104 a manufacturer for example has one part of his capital in the form of buildings fitted and destined for carrying on this branch of manufacture <\s>
<s> another part he has in the form of machinery <\s>
<s> a third consists if he be a spinner of raw cotton flax or wool if a weaver of flaxen woolen silk or cotton thread and the like according to the nature of the manufacture <\s>
<s> food and clothing for his operatives it is not the custom of the present age that he should directly provide and few capitalists except the producers of food or clothing have any portion worth mentioning of their capital in that shape <\s>
<s> instead of this each capitalist has money which he pays to his work people and so enables them to supply themselves <\s>
<s> what then is his capital <\s>
<s> precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>

<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>

<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> examination of cases illustrative of the idea of capital <\s>
<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>

<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>

<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>

<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> what then is his capital <\s>
<s> precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> fundamental propositions respecting capital <\s>
<s> industry is limited by capital <\s>
<s> the first of these propositions is that industry is limited by capital <\s>
<s> to employ labor in a manufacture is to invest capital in the manufacture <\s>
<s> this implies that industry can not be employed to any greater extent than there is capital to invest <\s>
<s> the proposition indeed must be assented to as soon as it is distinctly apprehended <\s>

<s> some of the results of past labor are required to be set aside to sustain the laborer while producing <\s>

<s> general walker    political economy    pages 68 70 defines capital as that portion of wealth excluding unimproved land and natural agents which is employed in the production of new forms of wealth <\s>

<s>    these auxiliary products accumulated with a view to the production to which they are subservient    form what is called capital <\s>

<s> roschers definition is    every product laid by for purposes of further production       political economy    section 42 by some labor is regarded as capital 104 a manufacturer for example has one part of his capital in the form of buildings fitted and destined for carrying on this branch of manufacture <\s>
<s> another part he has in the form of machinery <\s>
<s> a third consists if he be a spinner of raw cotton flax or wool if a weaver of flaxen woolen silk or cotton thread and the like according to the nature of the manufacture <\s>
<s> food and clothing for his operatives it is not the custom of the present age that he should directly provide and few capitalists except the producers of food or clothing have any portion worth mentioning of their capital in that shape <\s>
<s> instead of this each capitalist has money which he pays to his work people and so enables them to supply themselves <\s>
<s> what then is his capital <\s>
<s> precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>

<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>

<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>

<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> examination of cases illustrative of the idea of capital <\s>
<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>

<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>

<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>

<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>

<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>

<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>

<s> to employ labor in a manufacture is to invest capital in the manufacture <\s>

<s> the proposition indeed must be assented to as soon as it is distinctly apprehended <\s>

<s> roschers definition is    every product laid by for purposes of further production       political economy    section 42 by some labor is regarded as capital 104 a manufacturer for example has one part of his capital in the form of buildings fitted and destined for carrying on this branch of manufacture <\s>
<s> another part he has in the form of machinery <\s>
<s> a third consists if he be a spinner of raw cotton flax or wool if a weaver of flaxen woolen silk or cotton thread and the like according to the nature of the manufacture <\s>
<s> food and clothing for his operatives it is not the custom of the present age that he should directly provide and few capitalists except the producers of food or clothing have any portion worth mentioning of their capital in that shape <\s>
<s> instead of this each capitalist has money which he pays to his work people and so enables them to supply themselves <\s>
<s> what then is his capital <\s>
<s> precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>

<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>

<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>

<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>

<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
<s> so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers <\s>
<s> the distinction then between capital and not capital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalistin his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment <\s>
<s> more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it <\s>
<s> as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production <\s>
<s> this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations <\s>
<s> 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital <\s>
<s> 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital <\s>
<s> this is not an important distinction <\s>
<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>
<s> he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor <\s>
<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>
<s> this therefore must be paid out of his capital <\s>
<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>
<s> in fact however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient to purchase tools and materials <\s>
<s> the various elements of capital are materials instruments and subsistence giving    instruments    its wide signification which includes money the tool of exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of production <\s>
<s> in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience <\s>
<s> it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital :( 105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist <\s>

<s> examination of cases illustrative of the idea of capital <\s>
<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>

<s> the goods are doubtless marketable at some price if offered low enough <\s>
<s> if no one wants them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that condition exists <\s>
<s> 3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material <\s>
<s> the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on <\s>

<s> 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters    rent before obtaining any return from the produce <\s>

<s> 5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production <\s>
<s> as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed <\s>
<s> the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption until the completion of the industrial operation <\s>

<s> that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else <\s>
<s> let the reader consider in the four following suppositions whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the circle in the diagram page 67 <\s>
<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> in 3 and 4 the wealth is entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can not of course be in circle b <\s>
<s> 1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in bs occupation <\s>
<s> it is as much capital as if it belonged to b <\s>
<s> a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property <\s>
<s> capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in productionin maintaining laborers and providing tools and materialswhich capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a <\s>
<s> this is the simplest case <\s>
<s> 2 suppose next that as ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining road making or permanent manures <\s>
<s> this is productive employment <\s>
<s> the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated <\s>
<s> they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold <\s>
<s> here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country <\s>
<s> this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on <\s>
<s> 3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments <\s>
<s> in a year or two it is dissipated and without return <\s>
<s> a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount <\s>
<s> c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer <\s>
<s> it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent <\s>
<s> no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively <\s>
<s> but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers <\s>
<s> by cs prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return <\s>
<s> cs tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers tool makers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring classes while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not <\s>
<s> there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of cs unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value <\s>
<s> to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on cs estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community <\s>
<s> a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguisheddissipated and destroyed by cs prodigality <\s>
<s> a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital <\s>
<s> 4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state <\s>
<s> a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income <\s>
<s> if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and as property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and as ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longervirtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable <\s>
<s> as subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other peoples capital and industry <\s>
<s> the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent as money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent <\s>
<s> the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august 31 1865 2,845 907,626 and to june 30 1881 the government had paid in interest on its bonds    from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital    1,270 596,784 as an income to bondholders <\s>

<s> fundamental propositions respecting capital <\s>
<s> industry is limited by capital <\s>
<s> the first of these propositions is that industry is limited by capital <\s>
<s> to employ labor in a manufacture is to invest capital in the manufacture <\s>
<s> this implies that industry can not be employed to any greater extent than there is capital to invest <\s>
<s> the proposition indeed must be assented to as soon as it is distinctly apprehended <\s>
<s> the expression    applying capital    is of course metaphorical what is really applied is labor capital being an indispensable condition <\s>
<s> professor fawcett    manual    chap <\s>
<s> ii says    since the laborer must be fed by previously accumulated food ... <\s>
<s> some of the results of past labor are required to be set aside to sustain the laborer while producing <\s>
<s> the third requisite of production therefore is a fund reserved from consumption and devoted to sustain those engaged in future production .... <\s>
<s> capital is not confined to the food which feeds the laborers but includes machinery buildings and in fact every product due to mans labor which can be applied to assist his industry    chap <\s>
<s> general walker    political economy    pages 68 70 defines capital as that portion of wealth excluding unimproved land and natural agents which is employed in the production of new forms of wealth <\s>
<s> henry george    progress and poverty    page 41 returns to adam smiths definition    that part of a mans stock which he expects to yield him a revenue is called his capital    cherbuliez    prcis    page 70 points out the increasing interdependence of industrial operations as society increases in wealth and that there is not a single industry which does not demand the use of products obtained by previous labor <\s>
<s>    these auxiliary products accumulated with a view to the production to which they are subservient    form what is called capital <\s>
<s> carey    social science    iii page 48 regards as capital all things which in any way form the machinery by which society obtains wealth <\s>
<s> roschers definition is    every product laid by for purposes of further production       political economy    section 42 by some labor is regarded as capital 104 a manufacturer for example has one part of his capital in the form of buildings fitted and destined for carrying on this branch of manufacture <\s>
<s> another part he has in the form of machinery <\s>
<s> a third consists if he be a spinner of raw cotton flax or wool if a weaver of flaxen woolen silk or cotton thread and the like according to the nature of the manufacture <\s>
<s> food and clothing for his operatives it is not the custom of the present age that he should directly provide and few capitalists except the producers of food or clothing have any portion worth mentioning of their capital in that shape <\s>
<s> instead of this each capitalist has money which he pays to his work people and so enables them to supply themselves <\s>
<s> what then is his capital <\s>
<s> precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers <\s>
<s> care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and money <\s>
<s> capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital <\s>
<s> but money is only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c <\s>
<s> wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is necessarily wealth as included within it <\s>
<s> it is not always understood that money is merely a convenient article by which other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his possession <\s>
<s> in times of commercial depression that which is capital to day may not to morrow satisfy any desires i e not be in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely out of our circles above <\s>
<s> for the moment not having an exchange value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital <\s>
<s> outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle c overlapping edge of circle b suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods <\s>
<s> iron goods can not feed laborers <\s>
<s> nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed <\s>
<s> suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed <\s>
<s> the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food <\s>
<s> there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes <\s>
<s> food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry <\s>
