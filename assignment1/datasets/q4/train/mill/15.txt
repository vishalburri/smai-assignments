<s> to include    wages of superintendence    in profits of capital is to unnecessarily complicate one of the most serious economic questionsnamely the relations of capital and labor <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits what produces variations in the amount of profits <\s>
<s> the lowest rate of profit that can permanently exist is that which is barely adequate at the given place and time to afford an equivalent for the abstinence risk and exertion implied in the employment of capital <\s>
<s> from the gross profit has first to be deducted as much as will form a fund sufficient on the average to cover all losses incident to the employment <\s>
<s> next it must afford such an equivalent to the owner of the capital for forbearing to consume it as is then and there a sufficient motive to him to persist in his abstinence <\s>
<s> how much will be required to form this equivalent depends on the comparative value placed in the given society upon the present and the future in the words formerly used ): on the strength of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> further after covering all losses and remunerating the owner for forbearing to consume there must be something left to recompense the labor and skill of the person who devotes his time to the business <\s>

<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>
<s> to conclude this subject i must repeat an observation already made that there are kinds of labor of which the wages are fixed by custom and not by competition <\s>
<s> such are the fees or charges of professional personsof physicians surgeons barristers and even attorneys <\s>

<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>

<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>

<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>

<s> a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view <\s>
<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>
<s> and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them    although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult <\s>
<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>

<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>

<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>

<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>

<s> a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view <\s>
<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>
<s> and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them    although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult <\s>
<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>

<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>

<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>

<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>

<s> a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view <\s>
<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>
<s> and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them    although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult <\s>
<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>

<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>

<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>

<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>

<s> a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view <\s>
<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>
<s> and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them    although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult <\s>
<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>

<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>

<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>

<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>

<s> a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view <\s>
<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>
<s> and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them    although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult <\s>
<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>

<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>

<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>

<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>

<s> a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view <\s>
<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>
<s> and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them    although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult <\s>
<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>

<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>

<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>

<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>

<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>

<s> further after covering all losses and remunerating the owner for forbearing to consume there must be something left to recompense the labor and skill of the person who devotes his time to the business <\s>
<s> such then is the minimum of profits but that minimum is exceedingly variable and at some times and places extremely low on account of the great variableness of two out of its three elements <\s>
<s> the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted    the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly <\s>
<s> if all laborers were trustworthy it would not be necessary to give extra pay to working goldsmiths on account of the trust <\s>
<s> the degree of integrity required being supposed to be uncommon those who can make it appear that they possess it are able to take advantage of the peculiarity and obtain higher pay in proportion to its rarity <\s>
<s> this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the causes which give able executive managers who watch over productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under the name of    wages of superintendence    if successful managers of cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the latter <\s>
<s> able executive and business managers secure high wages solely on the groundas explained aboveof monopoly that is because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively to the demand for them in every industry in the land <\s>
<s> 5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated <\s>
<s> wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition <\s>
<s> but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages <\s>
<s> but the fact that a course of instruction is required of even a low degree of costliness or that the laborer must be maintained for a considerable time from other sources suffices everywhere to exclude the great body of the laboring people from the possibility of any such competition <\s>
<s> until lately all employments which required even the humble education of reading and writing could be recruited only from a select class the majority having had no opportunity of acquiring those attainments <\s>
<s> here is found the germ of the idea which has been elaborately worked out by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 175 in his theory of non competing groups of laborers    what we find in effect is not a whole population competing indiscriminately for all occupations but a series of industrial layers superposed on one another within each of which the various candidates for employment possess a real and effective power of selection while those occupying the several strata are for all purposes of effective competition practically isolated from each other    mr <\s>
<s> mill certainly understood this fully and stated it clearly again in book iii chap <\s>
<s> ii   2 the changes however now so rapidly taking place in usages and ideas are undermining all these distinctions the habits or disabilities which chained people to their hereditary condition are fast wearing away and every class is exposed to increased and increasing competition from at least the class immediately below it <\s>
<s> the general relaxation of conventional barriers and the increased facilities of education which already are and will be in a much greater degree brought within the reach of all tend to produce among many excellent effects one which is the reverse they tend to bring down the wages of skilled labor <\s>
<s> effect on wages of the competition of persons having other means of support <\s>
<s> a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view <\s>
<s> while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price <\s>
<s> adam smith has pointed out that    whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them <\s>
<s> but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of <\s>
<s> and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them    although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult <\s>
<s> it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence <\s>
<s> of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called    poor scholars    persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments <\s>
<s> when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments <\s>
<s> the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures <\s>
<s> when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it <\s>
<s> the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand <\s>
<s> if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers <\s>
<s> but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production <\s>
<s> thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation <\s>
<s> for the same reason it is found that c  teris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work <\s>
<s> the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone <\s>
<s> it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before <\s>
<s> this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of wages 176 both in england and the united states <\s>
<s> in our cotton mills where women do certain kinds of work equally well with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside employments into which women can not enter <\s>
<s> blacksmiths per week 16.74 family of four drawers in cotton millman per week 5.50 family of four drawers in cotton millwoman per week 5.50 family of four tenders two boys 4.50 total 15.50 in this case the family of four all together receive only about the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone <\s>
<s> wages of women why lower than those of men <\s>
<s> where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid <\s>
<s> women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in hand loom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test <\s>
<s> when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom <\s>
<s> but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women <\s>
<s> the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men <\s>
<s> in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share <\s>
<s> in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded <\s>
<s> yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and dress making certain women are able to charge excessively high prices for work because having obtained a reputation for especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of their articles what is really their high wages <\s>
<s> within these employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are requisite for the success of any one either man or woman <\s>
<s> it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men <\s>
<s> the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being <\s>
<s> now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this <\s>
<s> where the wife of a laboring man does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the mans wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs <\s>
<s> thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances <\s>
<s> but law or custom may interfere to limit competition <\s>
<s> if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect <\s>
<s> those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors <\s>
<s> putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over population and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves <\s>
