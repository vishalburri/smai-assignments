<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>

<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>

<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>
<s> more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances <\s>

<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>
<s> the capital of the employer forms the revenue of the laborers and if this exceeds the necessaries of life it gives them a surplus which they may either expend in enjoyments or save <\s>
<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>
<s> the unproductive consumption however of all classesnot merely that of the working menis the possible fund which may be saved <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>
<s> in order to induce the laboring classes to improve their condition and save capital it is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present sacrifice <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>

<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>

<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>

<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>
<s> more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances <\s>

<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>
<s> the capital of the employer forms the revenue of the laborers and if this exceeds the necessaries of life it gives them a surplus which they may either expend in enjoyments or save <\s>
<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>
<s> the unproductive consumption however of all classesnot merely that of the working menis the possible fund which may be saved <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>
<s> in order to induce the laboring classes to improve their condition and save capital it is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present sacrifice <\s>

<s> we have next therefore to inquire into the conditions of the increase of capital the causes by which the rapidity of its increase is determined and the necessary limitations of that increase <\s>
<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>
<s> more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances <\s>

<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>
<s> the capital of the employer forms the revenue of the laborers and if this exceeds the necessaries of life it gives them a surplus which they may either expend in enjoyments or save <\s>
<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>
<s> in order to induce the laboring classes to improve their condition and save capital it is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present sacrifice <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>

<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>
<s> more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances <\s>

<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>

<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>
<s> in order to induce the laboring classes to improve their condition and save capital it is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present sacrifice <\s>

<s> we have next therefore to inquire into the conditions of the increase of capital the causes by which the rapidity of its increase is determined and the necessary limitations of that increase <\s>
<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>
<s> more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances <\s>

<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>
<s> the capital of the employer forms the revenue of the laborers and if this exceeds the necessaries of life it gives them a surplus which they may either expend in enjoyments or save <\s>
<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>
<s> the unproductive consumption however of all classesnot merely that of the working menis the possible fund which may be saved <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>
<s> in order to induce the laboring classes to improve their condition and save capital it is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present sacrifice <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>

<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>

<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>

<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>

<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>

<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>

<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>

<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>
<s> more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances <\s>

<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>
<s> the capital of the employer forms the revenue of the laborers and if this exceeds the necessaries of life it gives them a surplus which they may either expend in enjoyments or save <\s>
<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>
<s> the unproductive consumption however of all classesnot merely that of the working menis the possible fund which may be saved <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>
<s> in order to induce the laboring classes to improve their condition and save capital it is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present sacrifice <\s>

<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>

<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>

<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>

<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>

<s> of the law of the increase of capital <\s>
<s> means for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> the requisites of production being labor capital and land it has been seen from the preceding chapter that the impediments to the increase of production do not arise from the first of these elements <\s>
<s> but production has other requisites and of these the one which we shall next consider is capital <\s>
<s> there can not be more people in any country or in the world than can be supported from the produce of past labor until that of present labor comes in although it is not to be supposed that capital consists wholly of food <\s>
<s> we have next therefore to inquire into the conditions of the increase of capital the causes by which the rapidity of its increase is determined and the necessary limitations of that increase <\s>
<s> since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two thingsthe amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it <\s>
<s> 1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair <\s>
<s> more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances <\s>
<s> as much as this though it never is saved always might be <\s>
<s> this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital <\s>
<s> the capital of the employer forms the revenue of the laborers and if this exceeds the necessaries of life it gives them a surplus which they may either expend in enjoyments or save <\s>
<s> it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the laborer can be saved <\s>
<s> when it is considered how enormous a sum is spent by the working classes in drink alone and also in the great reserves of the trades unions collected for purposes of strikes it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which savings can be made and by which they themselves may become capitalists <\s>
<s> the great accumulations in the savings banks by small depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is actually saved <\s>
<s> in 1882 1883 there were 2,876 438 persons who had deposited in the savings banks of the united states 1,024 856,787 with an average to each depositor of 356.29 <\s>
<s> the unproductive consumption however of all classesnot merely that of the working menis the possible fund which may be saved <\s>
<s> that being the amount which can be saved how much will be saved depends on the strength of the desire to save <\s>
<s> the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved <\s>
<s> the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved <\s>
<s> a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase <\s>
<s> the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation <\s>
<s> motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries <\s>
<s> but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings <\s>
<s> with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities <\s>
<s> 2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good <\s>
<s> this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of accumulation and is far more important than any other <\s>
<s> it is in short the test of civilization <\s>
<s> in order to induce the laboring classes to improve their condition and save capital it is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present sacrifice <\s>
<s> it is to be sure the whole problem of creating character and belongs to sociology and ethics rather than to political economy <\s>
<s> in weighing the future against the present the uncertainty of all things future is a leading element and that uncertainty is of very different degrees <\s>
<s>    all circumstances    therefore    increasing the probability of the provision we make for futurity being enjoyed by ourselves or others tend    justly and reasonably    to give strength to the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
