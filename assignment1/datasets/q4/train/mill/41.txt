<s> taxes on particular commodities fall on the consumer <\s>
<s> a tax on any one commodity whether laid on its production its importation its carriage from place to place or its sale and whether the tax be a fixed sum of money for a given quantity of the commodity or an ad valorem duty will as a general rule raise the value and price of the commodity by at least the amount of the tax <\s>
<s> there are few cases in which it does not raise them by more than that amount <\s>
<s> in the first place there are few taxes on production on account of which it is not found or deemed necessary to impose restrictive regulations on the manufacturers or dealers in order to check evasions of the tax <\s>
<s> these regulations are always sources of trouble and annoyance and generally of expense for all of which being peculiar disadvantages the producers or dealers must have compensation in the price of their commodity <\s>
<s> these restrictions also frequently interfere with the processes of manufacture requiring the producer to carry on his operations in the way most convenient to the revenue though not the cheapest or most efficient for purposes of production <\s>
<s> any regulations whatever enforced by law make it difficult for the producer to adopt new and improved processes <\s>
<s> further the necessity of advancing the tax obliges producers and dealers to carry on their business with larger capitals than would otherwise be necessary on the whole of which they must receive the ordinary rate of profit though a part only is employed in defraying the real expenses of production or importation <\s>
<s> the price of the article must be such as to afford a profit on more than its natural value instead of a profit on only its natural value <\s>
<s> neither ought it to be forgotten that whatever renders a larger capital necessary in any trade or business limits the competition in that business and by giving something like a monopoly to a few dealers may enable them either to keep up the price beyond what would afford the ordinary rate of profit or to obtain the ordinary rate of profit with a less degree of exertion for improving and cheapening their commodity <\s>
<s> in these several modes taxes on commodities often cost to the consumer through the increased price of the article much more than they bring into the treasury of the state <\s>
<s> there is still another consideration the higher price necessitated by the tax almost always checks the demand for the commodity and since there are many improvements in production which to make them practicable require a certain extent of demand such improvements are obstructed and many of them prevented altogether <\s>
<s> it is a well known fact that the branches of production in which fewest improvements are made are those with which the revenue officer interferes and that nothing in general gives a greater impulse to improvements in the production of a commodity than taking off a tax which narrowed the market for it <\s>
<s> peculiar effects of taxes on necessaries <\s>
<s> such are the effects of taxes on commodities considered generally but as there are some commodities those composing the necessaries of the laborer of which the values have an influence on the distribution of wealth among different classes of the community it is requisite to trace the effects of taxes on those particular articles somewhat further <\s>
<s> if a tax be laid say on corn and the price rises in proportion to the tax the rise of price may operate in two ways first it may lower the condition of the laboring classes temporarily indeed it can scarcely fail to do so <\s>
<s> if it diminishes their consumption of the produce of the earth or makes them resort to a food which the soil produces more abundantly and therefore more cheaply it to that extent contributes to throw back agriculture upon more fertile lands or less costly processes and to lower the value and price of corn which therefore ultimately settles at a price increased not by the whole amount of the tax but by only a part of its amount <\s>
<s> secondly however it may happen that the dearness of the taxed food does not lower the habitual standard of the laborers requirements but that wages on the contrary through an action on population rise in shorter or longer periods so as to compensate the laborers for their portion of the tax the compensation being of course at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> taxes on necessaries must thus have one of two effects either they lower the condition of the laboring classes or they exact from the owners of capital in addition to the amount due to the state on their own necessaries the amount due on those consumed by the laborers <\s>
<s> in the last case the tax on necessaries like a tax on wages is equivalent to a peculiar tax on profits which is like all other partial taxation unjust and is specially prejudicial to the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> it remains to speak of the effect on rent <\s>
<s> assuming what is usually the fact that the consumption of food is not diminished the same cultivation as before will be necessary to supply the wants of the community the margin of cultivation to use dr <\s>
<s> chalmerss expression remains where it was and the same land or capital which as the least productive already regulated the value and price of the whole produce will continue to regulate them <\s>
<s> the effect which a tax on agricultural produce will have on rent depends on its affecting or not affecting the difference between the return to this least productive land or capital and the returns to other lands and capitals <\s>
<s> now this depends on the manner in which the tax is imposed <\s>
<s> if it is an ad valorem tax or what is the same thing a fixed proportion of the produce such as tithe for example it evidently lowers corn rents <\s>
<s> for it takes more corn from the better lands than from the worse and exactly in the degree in which they are better land of twice the productiveness paying twice as much to the tithe <\s>
<s> whatever takes more from the greater of two quantities than from the less diminishes the difference between them <\s>
<s> the imposition of a tithe on corn would take a tithe also from corn rent for if we reduce a series of numbers by a tenth each the differences between them are reduced one tenth <\s>
<s> for example let there be five qualities of land which severally yield on the same extent of ground and with the same expenditure 100 90 80 70 and 60 bushels of wheat the last of these being the lowest quality which the demand for food renders it necessary to cultivate <\s>
<s> the rent of these lands will be as follows the land producing 100 bushels will yield a rent of 100 60 or 40 bushels <\s>
<s> that producing 90 bushels a rent of 90 60 or 30 bushels <\s>
<s> that producing 80 bushels a rent of 80 60 or 20 bushels <\s>
<s> that producing 70 bushels a rent of 70 60 or 10 bushels <\s>
<s> that producing 60 bushels will yield no rent <\s>
<s> now let a tithe be imposed which takes from these five pieces of land 10 9 8 7 and 6 bushels respectively the fifth quality still being the one which regulates the price but returning to the farmer after payment of tithe no more than 54 bushels the land producing 100 bushels reduced to 90 will yield a rent of 90 54 or 36 bushels <\s>
<s> that producing 90 bushels reduced to 81 a rent of 81 54 or 27 bushels <\s>
<s> that producing 80 bushels reduced to 72 a rent of 72 54 or 18 bushels <\s>
<s> that producing 70 bushels reduced to 63 a rent of 63 54 or 9 bushels <\s>
<s> and that producing 60 bushels reduced to 54 will yield as before no rent <\s>
<s> so that the rent of the first quality of land has lost four bushels of the second three of the third two and of the fourth one that is each has lost exactly one tenth <\s>
<s> a tax therefore of a fixed proportion of the produce lowers in the same proportion corn rent <\s>
<s> but it is only corn rent that is lowered and not rent estimated in money or in any other commodity <\s>
<s> for in the same proportion as corn rent is reduced in quantity the corn composing it is raised in value <\s>
<s> under the tithe 54 bushels will be worth in the market what 60 were before and nine tenths will in all cases sell for as much as the whole ten tenths previously sold for <\s>
<s> the landlords will therefore be compensated in value and price for what they lose in quantity and will suffer only so far as they consume their rent in kind or after receiving it in money expend it in agricultural produce that is they only suffer as consumers of agricultural produce and in common with all the other consumers <\s>
<s> considered as landlords they have the same income as before the tithe therefore falls on the consumer and not on the landlord <\s>
<s> the same effect would be produced on rent if the tax instead of being a fixed proportion of the produce were a fixed sum per quarter or per bushel <\s>
<s> a tax which takes a shilling for every bushel takes more shillings from one field than from another just in proportion as it produces more bushels and operates exactly like tithe except that tithe is not only the same proportion on all lands but is also the same proportion at all times while a fixed sum of money per bushel will amount to a greater or less proportion according as corn is cheap or dear <\s>
<s> there are other modes of taxing agriculture which would affect rent differently <\s>
<s> a tax proportioned to the rent would fall wholly on the rent and would not at all raise the price of corn which is regulated by the portion of the produce that pays no rent <\s>
<s> a fixed tax of so much per cultivated acre without distinction of value would have effects directly the reverse <\s>
<s> taking no more from the best qualities of land than from the worst it would leave the differences the same as before and consequently the same corn rents and the landlords would profit to the full extent of the rise of price <\s>
<s> to put the thing in another manner the price must rise sufficiently to enable the worst land to pay the tax thus enabling all lands which produce more than the worst to pay not only the tax but also an increased rent to the landlords <\s>
<s> these however are not so much taxes on the produce of land as taxes on the land itself <\s>
<s> taxes on the produce properly so called whether fixed or ad valorem do not affect rent but fall on the consumer profits however generally bearing either the whole or the greatest part of the portion which is levied on the consumption of the laboring classes <\s>
<s>    how modified by the tendency of profits to a minimum <\s>
<s> the preceding is i apprehend a correct statement of the manner in which taxes on agricultural produce operate when first laid on <\s>
<s> when however they are of old standing their effect may be different <\s>
<s> now the effect of accumulation when attended by its usual accompaniment an increase of population is to increase the value and price of food to raise rent and to lower profits that is to do precisely what is done by a tax on agricultural produce except that this does not raise rent <\s>
<s> the tax therefore merely anticipates the rise of price and fall of profits which would have taken place ultimately through the mere progress of accumulation while it at the same time prevents or at least retards that progress <\s>
<s> if the rate of profit was such that the effect of the tithe reduces it to the practical minimum after a lapse of time which would have admitted of a rise of one tenth from the natural progress of wealth the consumer will be paying no more than he would have paid if the tithe had never existed he will have ceased to pay any portion of it and the person who will really pay it is the landlord whom it deprives of the increase of rent which would by that time have accrued to him <\s>
<s> at every successive point in this interval of time less of the burden will rest on the consumer and more of it on the landlord and in the ultimate result the minimum of profits will be reached with a smaller capital and population and a lower rental than if the course of things had not been disturbed by the imposition of the tax <\s>
<s> if on the other hand the tithe or other tax on agricultural produce does not reduce profits to the minimum but to something above the minimum accumulation will not be stopped but only slackened and if population also increases the twofold increase will continue to produce its effectsa rise of the price of corn and an increase of rent <\s>
<s> these consequences however will not take place with the same rapidity as if the higher rate of profit had continued <\s>
<s> at the end of twenty years the country will have a smaller population and capital than but for the tax it would by that time have had the landlords will have a smaller rent and the price of corn having increased less rapidly than it would otherwise have done will not be so much as a tenth higher than what if there had been no tax it would by that time have become <\s>
<s> a part of the tax therefore will already have ceased to fall on the consumer and devolved upon the landlord and the proportion will become greater and greater by lapse of time <\s>
<s> but though tithes and other taxes on agricultural produce when of long standing either do not raise the price of food and lower profits at all or if at all not in proportion to the tax yet the abrogation of such taxes when they exist does not the less diminish price and in general raise the rate of profit <\s>
<s> the abolition of a tithe takes one tenth from the cost of production and consequently from the price of all agricultural produce and unless it permanently raises the laborers requirements it lowers the cost of labor and raises profits <\s>
<s> rent estimated in money or in commodities generally remains as before estimated in agricultural produce it is raised <\s>
<s> the country adds as much by the repeal of a tithe to the margin which intervenes between it and the stationary state as was cut off from that margin by the tithe when first imposed <\s>
<s> accumulation is greatly accelerated and if population also increases the price of corn immediately begins to recover itself and rent to rise thus gradually transferring the benefit of the remission from the consumer to the landlord <\s>
<s> effects of discriminating duties <\s>
<s> we have hitherto inquired into the effects of taxes on commodities on the assumption that they are levied impartially on every mode in which the commodity can be produced or brought to market <\s>
<s> another class of considerations is opened if we suppose that this impartiality is not maintained and that the tax is imposed not on the commodity but on some particular mode of obtaining it <\s>
<s> suppose that a commodity is capable of being made by two different processesas a manufactured commodity may be produced either by hand or by steam powersugar may be made either from the sugar cane or from beet root cattle fattened either on hay and green crops or on oil cake and the refuse of breweries <\s>
<s> it is the interest of the community that of the two methods producers should adopt that which produces the best article at the lowest price <\s>
<s> this being also the interest of the producers unless protected against competition and shielded from the penalties of indolence the process most advantageous to the community is that which if not interfered with by government they ultimately find it to their advantage to adopt <\s>
<s> suppose however that a tax is laid on one of the processes and no tax at all or one of smaller amount on the other <\s>
<s> if the taxed process is the one which the producers would not have adopted the measure is simply nugatory <\s>
<s> but if the tax falls as it is of course intended to do upon the one which they would have adopted it creates an artificial motive for preferring the untaxed process though the inferior of the two <\s>
<s> if therefore it has any effect at all it causes the commodity to be produced of worse quality or at a greater expense of labor it causes so much of the labor of the community to be wasted and the capital employed in supporting and remunerating that labor to be expended as uselessly as if it were spent in hiring men to dig holes and fill them up again <\s>
<s> this waste of labor and capital constitutes an addition to the cost of production of the commodity which raises its value and price in a corresponding ratio and thus the owners of the capital are indemnified <\s>
<s> the loss falls on the consumers though the capital of the country is also eventually diminished by the diminution of their means of saving and in some degree of their inducements to save <\s>
<s> the kind of tax therefore which comes under the general denomination of a discriminating duty transgresses the rule that taxes should take as little as possible from the taxpayer beyond what they bring into the treasury of the state <\s>
<s> a discriminating duty makes the consumer pay two distinct taxes only one of which is paid to the government and that frequently the less onerous of the two <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on sugar produced from the cane leaving the sugar from beet root untaxed then in so far as cane sugar continued to be used the tax on it would be paid to the treasury and might be as unobjectionable as most other taxes but if cane sugar having previously been cheaper than beet root sugar was now dearer and beet root sugar was to any considerable amount substituted for it and fields laid out and manufactories established in consequence the government would gain no revenue from the beet root sugar while the consumers of it would pay a real tax <\s>
<s> they would pay for beet root sugar more than they had previously paid for cane sugar and the difference would go to indemnify producers for a portion of the labor of the country actually thrown away in producing by the labor of say three hundred men what could be obtained by the other process with the labor of two hundred <\s>
<s> an interesting illustration in late years of the operation of a discriminating duty is to be found in the case of different grades of sugar imported into the united states <\s>
<s> our tariff levied certain duties on different grades of sugar classified by color on the theory that color was a test of saccharine strength <\s>
<s> cargoes were examined and compared with graded sugars hermetically sealed in glass bottles and distributed by the dutch authorities whence came the name of    dutch standard    grades from no <\s>
<s> 1 melado to no <\s>
<s> 10 must go to the refiner before consumption but the grades to no <\s>
<s> 13 although some might have gone into immediate consumption were usually sent to be manufactured into the highest grades of soft and hard sugars <\s>
<s> so long as the sugar was secured by evaporation in open coppers or by passing the molasses through a layer of clay saccharine strength and color went fairly well together <\s>
<s> but with the invention of the vacuum pan and the centrifugal wheel by which the sugar is reduced through a shorter and more effective process sugar of a certain grade of color by the dutch standard contained a much greater degree of sweetness than that produced by the old methods <\s>
<s> cuban planters therefore were permitted to send sugar into this country at a duty which was really levied on grades much inferior and so paid a less duty than other sugars <\s>
<s> the products of one country were discriminated against in favor of another <\s>
<s> the difficulty was settled by using the polariscope which gave an absolute chemical test of the sweetness irrespective of color <\s>
<s> one of the commonest cases of discriminating duties is that of a tax on the importation of a commodity capable of being produced at home unaccompanied by an equivalent tax on the home production <\s>
