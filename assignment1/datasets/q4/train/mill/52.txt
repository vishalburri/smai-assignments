<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> 333 in his last edition of his    manual    professor fawcett thus describes a co operative experiment in agriculture    the one that has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since by mr <\s>
<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>

<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> 333 in his last edition of his    manual    professor fawcett thus describes a co operative experiment in agriculture    the one that has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since by mr <\s>
<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>

<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>

<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> 333 in his last edition of his    manual    professor fawcett thus describes a co operative experiment in agriculture    the one that has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since by mr <\s>
<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>

<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> 333 in his last edition of his    manual    professor fawcett thus describes a co operative experiment in agriculture    the one that has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since by mr <\s>
<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 333 in his last edition of his    manual    professor fawcett thus describes a co operative experiment in agriculture    the one that has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since by mr <\s>
<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 333 in his last edition of his    manual    professor fawcett thus describes a co operative experiment in agriculture    the one that has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since by mr <\s>
<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>

<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>

<s> 333 in his last edition of his    manual    professor fawcett thus describes a co operative experiment in agriculture    the one that has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since by mr <\s>
<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>
<s> but there is no sufficient reason against taxing the materials and instruments used in the production of anything which is itself a fit object of taxation    mill <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>
<s> but there is no sufficient reason against taxing the materials and instruments used in the production of anything which is itself a fit object of taxation    mill <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>

<s> gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was prompted to do something on their behalf <\s>
<s> when therefore one of his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent   150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it <\s>
<s> as they of course had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance loaned them the requisite stock and implements <\s>
<s> the laborers were in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share <\s>
<s> the plan was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and the stock and implements became the property of the laborers <\s>
<s> each share greatly increased in value <\s>
<s> gurdon was so much encouraged not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but also by the general improvement effected in their condition that some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar terms <\s>
<s> although no statement of accounts has ever been published the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and implements on the farms <\s>
<s> one of the most significant and hopeful circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural population has been better developed co operation may be applied in a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking results than were obtained at assington .... <\s>
<s> in the description which has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated by the feeling of property <\s>
<s> when he cultivates his own plot of ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor <\s>
<s> each year with the extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale <\s>
<s> when therefore co operative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be avoided <\s>
<s> the progress toward co operative agriculture will no doubt be slow and gradual    334 godkin    north american review    1868 <\s>

<s> 342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation is often required not as a residence but for business <\s>
<s> but it is an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or manufactories ought to be exempted from house tax <\s>
<s> it has been also objected that house rent in the rural districts is much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would have a corresponding inequality of pressure <\s>
<s> to this however it may be answered that in places where house rent is low persons of the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses and thus expend in house rent more nearly the same proportion of their incomes than might at first sight appear <\s>
<s> or if not the probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore the strongest claim to be taxed lightly <\s>

<s> 345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from foreigners by a tax on exports is the opium trade with china <\s>
<s> the high price of the article under the government monopoly which is equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in silver    mill <\s>
<s> 346 a land tax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as it were in the place of a landlord <\s>
<s> this tax however is generally so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land <\s>
<s> so far as it goes it is a tax on rent <\s>
<s> 347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of taxation as the finished article <\s>
<s> it is chiefly with reference to foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious <\s>
<s> internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation <\s>
