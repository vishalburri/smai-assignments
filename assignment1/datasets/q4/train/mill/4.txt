<s> the editor begs to acknowledge his great indebtedness for information to his colleague professor charles f <\s>
<s> dunbar of harvard university <\s>
<s> systematic study for an understanding of the laws of political economy is to be found no farther back than the sixteenth century <\s>
<s> the history of political economy is not the history of economic institutions any more than the history of mathematics is the history of every object possessing length breadth and thickness <\s>
<s> economic history is the story of the gradual evolution in the thought of men of an understanding of the laws which to day constitute the science we are studying <\s>
<s> it is essentially modern 1 aristotle 2 and xenophon had some comprehension of the theory of money and plato 3 had defined its functions with some accuracy <\s>
<s> the economic laws of the romans were all summed up in the idea of enriching the metropolis at the expense of the dependencies <\s>
<s> during the middle ages no systematic study was undertaken and the nature of economic laws was not even suspected <\s>
<s> it is worth notice that the first glimmerings of political economy came to be seen through the discussions on money and the extraordinary movements of gold and silver <\s>
<s> about the time of charles v the young study was born accompanied by the revival of learning the reformation the discovery of america and the great fall in the value of gold and silver <\s>
<s> modern society was just beginning and had already brought manufactures into existencewoolens in england silks in france genoa and florence venice had become the great commercial city of the world the hanseatic league was carrying goods from the mediterranean to the baltic and the jews of lombardy had by that time brought into use the bill of exchange <\s>
<s> while the supply of the precious metals had been tolerably constant hitherto the steady increase of business brought about a fall of prices <\s>
<s> from the middle of the fourteenth to the end of the fifteenth century the purchasing power of money increased in the ratio of four to ten <\s>
<s> then into this situation came the great influx of gold and silver from the new world <\s>
<s> prices rose unequally the trading and manufacturing classes were flourishing while others were depressed <\s>
<s> in the sixteenth century the price of wheat tripled but wages only doubled the laboring classes of england deteriorated while others were enriched producing profound social changes and the well known flood of pauperism together with the rise of the mercantile classes <\s>
<s> then new channels of trade were opened to the east and west <\s>
<s> of course men saw but dimly the operation of these economic causes although the books now began to hint at the right understanding of the movements and the true laws of money <\s>
<s> even before this time however nicole orsme bishop of lisieux died 1382 had written intelligently on money ;( 4 but about 1526 the astronomer copernicus gave a very good exposition of some of the functions of money <\s>
<s> but he as well as latimer 5 while noticing the economic changes gave no correct explanation <\s>
<s> the seigneur de malestroit a councilor of the king of france however by his errors drew out jean bodin 6 to say that the rise of prices was due to the abundance of money brought from america <\s>
<s> but he was in advance of his time as well as william stafford 7 the author of the first english treatise on money which showed a perfect insight into the subject <\s>
<s> stafford distinctly grasped the idea that the high prices brought no loss to merchants great gain to those who held long leases and loss to those who did not buy and sell that in reality commodities were exchanged when money was passed from hand to hand <\s>
<s> such was the situation (8 which prefaced the first general system destined to be based on supposed economic considerations wrongly understood to be sure but vigorously carried out <\s>
<s> i refer to the well known mercantile system which over spread europe 9 spain as the first receiver of american gold and silver attributed to it abnormal power and by heavy duties and prohibitions tried to keep the precious metals to herself <\s>
<s> this led to a general belief in the tenets of the mercantile system and its adoption by all europe <\s>
<s> it was maintained that where gold and silver abounded there would be found no lack of the necessaries of life 2 <\s>
<s> therefore governments should do all in their power to secure an abundance of money <\s>
<s> noting that commerce and political power seemed to be in the hands of the states having the greatest quantity of money men wished mainly to create such a relation of exports and imports of goods as would bring about an importation of money <\s>
<s> the natural sequence of this was the policy of creating a favorable    balance of trade    by increasing exports and diminishing imports thus implying that the gain in international trade was not a mutual one <\s>
<s> the error consisted in supposing that a nation could sell without buying and in overlooking the instrumental character of money <\s>
<s> the errors even went so far as to create prohibitory legislation in the hope of shutting out imported goods and keeping the precious metals at home <\s>
<s> the system spread over europe so that france 1544 and england 1552 forbade the export of specie <\s>
<s> but with the more peaceful conditions at the end of the sixteenth century the expansion of commerce the value of money became steadier and prices advanced more slowly <\s>
<s> italian writers were among the first to discuss the laws of money intelligently 10 but a number of acute englishmen enriched the literature of the subject 11 and it may be said that any modern study of political economy received its first definite impulse from england and france <\s>
<s> the prohibition of the export of coin was embarrassing to the east india company and to merchants and mun tried to show that freedom of exportation would increase the amount of gold and silver in a country since the profits in foreign trade would bring back more than went out <\s>
<s> it probably was not clear to them however that the export of bullion to the east was advantageous because the commodities brought back in return were more valuable in england than the precious metals <\s>
<s> the purpose of the mercantilists was to increase the amount of gold and silver in the country <\s>
<s> mun with some penetration had even pointed out that too much money was an evil but in 1663 the english parliament removed the restriction on the exportation of coin <\s>
<s> the balance of trade heresy that exports should always exceed imports as if merchants would send out goods which when paid for in commodities should be returned in a form of less value than those sent out was the outcome of the mercantile system and it has continued in the minds of many men to this day <\s>
<s> the policy which aimed at securing a favorable balance of trade and the plan of protecting home industries had the same origin <\s>
<s> if all consumable goods were produced at home and none imported that would increase exports and bring more gold and silver into the country <\s>
<s> as all the countries of europe had adopted the mercantile theory after 1664 retaliatory and prohibitory tariffs were set up against each other by england france holland and germany <\s>
<s> then because it was seen that large sums were paid for carrying goods in order that no coin should be required to pay foreigners in any branch of industry navigation laws were enacted which required goods to be imported only in ships belonging to the importing nation <\s>
<s> these remnants of the mercantile system continue to this day in the shipping laws of this and other countries 12 a natural consequence of the navigation acts and of the mercantile system was the so called colonial policy by which the colonies were excluded from all trade except with the mother country <\s>
<s> a plantation like new england which produced commodities in competition with england was looked upon with disfavor for her enterprise and all this because of the fallacy at the foundation of the mercantile system that the gain in international trade is not mutual but that what one country gains another must lose 13 an exposition of mercantilism would not be complete without a statement of the form it assumed in france under the guidance of colbert 14 the great minister of louis xiv from 1661 to 1683 <\s>
<s> in order to create a favorable balance of trade he devoted himself to fostering home productions by attempts to abolish vexatious tolls and customs within the country and by an extraordinary system of supervision in manufacturing establishments which has been the stimulus to paternal government from which france has never since been able to free herself <\s>
<s> processes were borrowed from england germany and sweden and new establishments for making tapestries and silk goods sprang up even the sizes of fabrics were regulated by colbert and looms unsuitable for these sizes destroyed <\s>
<s> in 1671 wool dyers were given a code of detailed instructions as to the processes and materials that might be used <\s>
<s> long after french industry felt the difficulty of struggling with stereotyped processes <\s>
<s> his system however naturally resulted in a series of tariff measures in 1664 and 1667 <\s>
<s> moderate duties on the exportation of raw materials were first laid on followed by heavy customs imposed on the importation of foreign goods <\s>
<s> the shipment of coin was forbidden but colberts criterion of prosperity was the favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> french agriculture was overlooked <\s>
<s> the tariff of 1667 was based on the theory that foreigners must of necessity buy french wines lace and wheat that the french could sell but not buy but the act of 1667 cut off the demand for french goods and portuguese wines came into the market <\s>
<s> england and holland retaliated and shut off the foreign markets from france <\s>
<s> the wine and wheat growers of the latter country were ruined and the rural population came to the verge of starvation <\s>
<s> colberts last years were full of misfortune and disappointment and a new illustration was given of the fallacy that the gain from international trade was not mutual <\s>
<s> from this time economic principles began to be better apprehended <\s>
<s> it is to be noted that the first just observations arose from discussions upon money and thence upon international trade <\s>
<s> so far england has furnished the most acute writers now france became the scene of a new movement <\s>
<s> marshal vauban 15 the great soldier and boisguillebert 16 both began to emphasize the truth that wealth really consists not in money alone but in an abundance of commodities that countries which have plenty of gold and silver are not wealthier than others and that money is only a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it was not however until 1750 that evidences of any real advance began to appear for laws famous scheme 1716 1720 only served as a drag upon the growth of economic truth <\s>
<s> but in the middle of the eighteenth century an intellectual revival set in the    encyclopdia    was published montesquieu wrote his    lsprit des lois    rousseau was beginning to write and voltaire was at the height of his power <\s>
<s> in this movement political economy had an important share and there resulted the first school of economists termed the physiocrats <\s>
<s> the founder and leader of this new body of economic thinkers was franois quesnay 17 a physician and favorite at the court of louis xv <\s>
<s> passing by his ethical basis of a natural order of society and natural rights of man his main doctrine in brief was that the cultivation of the soil was the only source of wealth that labor in other industries was sterile and that freedom of trade was a necessary condition of healthy distribution <\s>
<s> while known as the    economists    they were also called the    physiocrats    18 or the    agricultural school    quesnay and his followers distinguished between the creation of wealth which could only come from the soil and the union of these materials once created by labor in other occupations <\s>
<s> in the latter case the laborer did not in their theory produce wealth <\s>
<s> a natural consequence of this view appeared in a rule of taxation by which all the burdens of state expenditure were laid upon the landed proprietors alone since they alone received a surplus of wealth the famous net produit above their sustenance and expenses of production <\s>
<s> this position of course did not recognize the old mercantile theory that foreign commerce enriched a nation solely by increasing the quantity of money <\s>
<s> to a physiocrat the wealth of a community was increased not by money but by an abundant produce from its own soil <\s>
<s> in fact quesnay argued that the right of property included the right to dispose of it freely at home or abroad unrestricted by the state <\s>
<s> this doctrine was formulated in the familiar expression    laissez faire laissez passer    19 condorcet and condillac favored the new ideas <\s>
<s> the    economists    became the fashion in france and even included in their number joseph ii of austria the kings of spain poland sweden naples catharine of russia and the margrave of baden 20 agriculture therefore received a great stimulus <\s>
<s> quesnay had many vigorous supporters of whom the most conspicuous was the marquis de mirabeau 21 father of him of the revolution and the culmination of their popularity was reached about 1764 <\s>
<s> a feeling that the true increase of wealth was not in a mere increase of money but in the products of the soil led them naturally into a reaction against mercantilism but also made them dogmatic and overbearing in their one sided system which did not recognize that labor in all industries created wealth <\s>
