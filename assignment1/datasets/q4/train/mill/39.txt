<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>

<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>

<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>

<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>

<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>

<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>

<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>

<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>

<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>

<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>

<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>

<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>

<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>

<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>

<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>

<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>

<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>

<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>

<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>

<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>

<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>

<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>

<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>

<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>

<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>

<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>

<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>

<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>

<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>

<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>

<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>

<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>

<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>

<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>

<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>

<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>

<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>

<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>

<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>

<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>

<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>

<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>

<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>

<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>

<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>

<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>

<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>

<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>

<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>

<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>

<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>

<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>

<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>

<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>

<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>

<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>

<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>

<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>

<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>

<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>

<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>

<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>

<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>

<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>

<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>

<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>

<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>

<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>

<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>

<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>

<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
<s> it has not the palliation of a graduated property tax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for    realized property    includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions <\s>
<s> i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether <\s>
<s> but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition <\s>
<s> the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on <\s>
<s> as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property <\s>
<s> future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax <\s>
<s> its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax <\s>
<s> the above proposition has been extended by those in the united states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the incomes of those who hold government bonds <\s>
<s> it so happened that for example the six dollars income on a one hundred dollar bond of the united states was not in the war period deemed a sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of taxation <\s>
<s> it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the one per cent tax less the expense of levying it <\s>
<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>

<s> in other words the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the provision was made <\s>
<s> if then a tax were now to be put upon the bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers the selling price of the bond itself as before explained 338   4 <\s>
<s> should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes <\s>
<s> whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether life incomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property <\s>
<s> the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike 339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants <\s>
<s> this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means <\s>
<s> when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever <\s>
<s> the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings <\s>
<s> it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate <\s>
<s> in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of   1,000 a year can not so well afford to pay   100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death <\s>
<s> if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by   300 of his income to take   100 from him as income tax is to take   100 from   700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption <\s>
<s> were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating   70 from his consumption and   30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as bs but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax <\s>
<s> the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income tax while bs heirs would only be charged once <\s>
<s> the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose <\s>
<s> if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an income tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved <\s>
<s> for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays income tax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal <\s>
<s> unless therefore savings are exempted from income tax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend <\s>
<s> to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributors means twice over <\s>
<s> no income tax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no income tax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed tax free as saving in the year preceding <\s>
<s> but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save <\s>
<s> in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of life incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made <\s>
<s> of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence <\s>
<s> the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes <\s>
<s> the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation <\s>
<s> suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part <\s>
<s> in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises <\s>
<s> this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class <\s>
<s> now this is actually the case with rent <\s>
<s> the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves <\s>
<s> they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing <\s>
<s> what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches <\s>
<s> in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies <\s>
<s> the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure <\s>
<s> the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country <\s>
<s> the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made <\s>
<s> of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price <\s>
<s> on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general land tax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor <\s>
<s> with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land <\s>
<s> it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors <\s>
<s> mill became president of the land tenure association one of whose objects was    to claim for the benefit of the state the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a great part of that increase which is continually taking place without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle may be adopted by the legislature    it is urged against this plan that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it should also make compensation for loss arising from declining rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in land 340   6 <\s>
<s> taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable <\s>
<s> in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid downnamely that it should fall on income and not on capital <\s>
<s> to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements <\s>
<s> there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital <\s>
<s> all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth <\s>
<s> but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt <\s>
<s> to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have donenamely to make a clear space for further saving <\s>
<s> i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital <\s>
<s> it is perfectly true that they are so <\s>
<s> as ricardo observes if   100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of   1,000 he considers the legacy as only   900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure <\s>
<s> the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection <\s>
<s> but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the tax payer to the fund holder <\s>
<s> but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth <\s>
<s> direct taxes either on income or expenditure <\s>
<s> taxes are either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it <\s>
<s> indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs <\s>
<s> the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price <\s>
<s> direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure <\s>
<s> most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer <\s>
<s> a house tax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house <\s>
<s> if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax <\s>
<s> a window tax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages <\s>
<s> the sources of income are rent profits and wages <\s>
<s> this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder <\s>
<s> taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them <\s>
<s> we will consider these in their order <\s>
<s> a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord <\s>
<s> there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else <\s>
<s> it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid <\s>
<s> this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants <\s>
<s> when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent <\s>
<s> a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlords profit <\s>
<s>    on profits <\s>
<s> a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer <\s>
<s> all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment <\s>
<s> if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits <\s>
<s> but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone <\s>
<s> there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account <\s>
<s> it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made <\s>
<s> if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax <\s>
<s> in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount <\s>
<s> the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off <\s>
<s> but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them <\s>
<s> if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching <\s>
<s> at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord <\s>
<s> the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth <\s>
<s> even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord <\s>
<s> one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation <\s>
<s> if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them <\s>
