<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>

<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>

<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>
<s> sites of remarkable beauty are generally limited in supply and therefore if in great demand are at a scarcity value <\s>

<s> utility or ability to satisfy a desire u <\s>
<s> difficulty of attainment d according to which there are three classes of commodities <\s>
<s> of the second condition there are three classes 1 <\s>

<s> of those whose supply is capable of indefinite increase their normal and permanent value is regulated by cost of production and their temporary or market value is regulated by demand and supply oscillating around cost of production which consists of the amount of labor and abstinence required <\s>
<s> of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2 <\s>
<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>

<s> utility or ability to satisfy a desire u <\s>

<s> of the second condition there are three classes 1 <\s>

<s> of those whose supply is capable of indefinite increase their normal and permanent value is regulated by cost of production and their temporary or market value is regulated by demand and supply oscillating around cost of production which consists of the amount of labor and abstinence required <\s>
<s> of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2 <\s>
<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>
<s> rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a land tax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage <\s>
<s> the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit the laboring classes a whit through lowering the price to them or any consumer of food or agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent of mines and fisheries and ground rent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent <\s>
<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>
<s> but this is not true of all mines <\s>

<s> utility or ability to satisfy a desire u <\s>
<s> difficulty of attainment d according to which there are three classes of commodities <\s>
<s> of the second condition there are three classes 1 <\s>

<s> of those whose supply is capable of indefinite increase their normal and permanent value is regulated by cost of production and their temporary or market value is regulated by demand and supply oscillating around cost of production which consists of the amount of labor and abstinence required <\s>
<s> of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2 <\s>
<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>
<s> rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a land tax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage <\s>
<s> the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit the laboring classes a whit through lowering the price to them or any consumer of food or agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent of mines and fisheries and ground rent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent <\s>
<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>
<s> but this is not true of all mines <\s>
<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>
<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>
<s> we may take salmon fisheries as an example of the whole class <\s>
<s> some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others <\s>
<s> none however without being exhausted can supply more than a very limited demand <\s>
<s> all others therefore will if appropriated afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority <\s>
<s> both in the case of mines and of fisheries the natural order of events is liable to be interrupted by the opening of a new mine or a new fishery of superior quality to some of those already in use <\s>
<s> in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in usethe one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commoditywill be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>

<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>
<s> rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a land tax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage <\s>
<s> the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit the laboring classes a whit through lowering the price to them or any consumer of food or agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent of mines and fisheries and ground rent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent <\s>
<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>
<s> but this is not true of all mines <\s>
<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>
<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>
<s> we may take salmon fisheries as an example of the whole class <\s>
<s> some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others <\s>
<s> none however without being exhausted can supply more than a very limited demand <\s>
<s> all others therefore will if appropriated afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority <\s>
<s> both in the case of mines and of fisheries the natural order of events is liable to be interrupted by the opening of a new mine or a new fishery of superior quality to some of those already in use <\s>
<s> in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in usethe one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commoditywill be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>
<s> sites of remarkable beauty are generally limited in supply and therefore if in great demand are at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> sites superior only in convenience are governed as to their value by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a house in a small village is but little higher than the rent of a similar patch of ground in the open fields <\s>
<s> suppose the various kinds of land to be represented by the alphabet that those below o pay no agricultural rent and that all lands increase in fertility and situation as we approach the beginning of the alphabet but which as far up as k are used in agriculture that higher than k all are more profitably used for building purposes viz a b c ... <\s>
<s> k l m n o ... <\s>
<s> now it will happen that land is chosen for building purposes irrespective of its fertility for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> it will not be true as some may think that no land will be used for building until it will pay a ground rent greater than the greatest agricultural rent paid by any piece of land <\s>
<s> it is not true for example if n be selected for a building lot that it must pay a ground rent as high as the agricultural rent of k the most fertile land cultivated in agriculture <\s>
<s> it must pay a ground rent higher only than it itself would pay if cultivated <\s>

<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>

<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>
<s> rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a land tax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage <\s>
<s> the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit the laboring classes a whit through lowering the price to them or any consumer of food or agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent of mines and fisheries and ground rent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent <\s>
<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>
<s> but this is not true of all mines <\s>
<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>
<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>
<s> we may take salmon fisheries as an example of the whole class <\s>
<s> some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others <\s>
<s> none however without being exhausted can supply more than a very limited demand <\s>
<s> all others therefore will if appropriated afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority <\s>
<s> both in the case of mines and of fisheries the natural order of events is liable to be interrupted by the opening of a new mine or a new fishery of superior quality to some of those already in use <\s>
<s> in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in usethe one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commoditywill be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>
<s> sites of remarkable beauty are generally limited in supply and therefore if in great demand are at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> sites superior only in convenience are governed as to their value by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a house in a small village is but little higher than the rent of a similar patch of ground in the open fields <\s>
<s> suppose the various kinds of land to be represented by the alphabet that those below o pay no agricultural rent and that all lands increase in fertility and situation as we approach the beginning of the alphabet but which as far up as k are used in agriculture that higher than k all are more profitably used for building purposes viz a b c ... <\s>
<s> k l m n o ... <\s>
<s> now it will happen that land is chosen for building purposes irrespective of its fertility for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> it will not be true as some may think that no land will be used for building until it will pay a ground rent greater than the greatest agricultural rent paid by any piece of land <\s>
<s> it is not true for example if n be selected for a building lot that it must pay a ground rent as high as the agricultural rent of k the most fertile land cultivated in agriculture <\s>
<s> it must pay a ground rent higher only than it itself would pay if cultivated <\s>
<s> it is only necessary that it pay more than the same not better land would pay as rent if used only in agriculture <\s>
<s> the rents of wharfage dock and harbor room water power and many other privileges may be analyzed on similar principles <\s>
<s> take the case for example of a patent or exclusive privilege for the use of a process by which the cost of production is lessened <\s>
<s> if the value of the product continues to be regulated by what it costs to those who are obliged to persist in the old process the patentee will make an extra profit equal to the advantage which his process possesses over theirs <\s>
<s> this extra profit is essentially similar to rent and sometimes even assumes the form of it the patentee allowing to other producers the use of his privilege in consideration of an annual payment <\s>
<s> the extra gains which any producer or dealer obtains through superior talents for business or superior business arrangements are very much of a similar kind <\s>
<s> if all his competitors had the same advantages and used them the benefit would be transferred to their customers through the diminished value of the article he only retains it for himself because he is able to bring his commodity to market at a lower cost while its value is determined by a higher 219   4 <\s>

<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>

<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>

<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>

<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>

<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>

<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>
<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>
<s> we may take salmon fisheries as an example of the whole class <\s>
<s> some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others <\s>
<s> none however without being exhausted can supply more than a very limited demand <\s>
<s> all others therefore will if appropriated afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority <\s>

<s> in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in usethe one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commoditywill be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>

<s> the rents of wharfage dock and harbor room water power and many other privileges may be analyzed on similar principles <\s>
<s> take the case for example of a patent or exclusive privilege for the use of a process by which the cost of production is lessened <\s>

<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>

<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>

<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>

<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>

<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>

<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>

<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>

<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>

<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>

<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>

<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>
<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>

<s> in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in usethe one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commoditywill be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>
<s> sites of remarkable beauty are generally limited in supply and therefore if in great demand are at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> sites superior only in convenience are governed as to their value by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>

<s> suppose the various kinds of land to be represented by the alphabet that those below o pay no agricultural rent and that all lands increase in fertility and situation as we approach the beginning of the alphabet but which as far up as k are used in agriculture that higher than k all are more profitably used for building purposes viz a b c ... <\s>

<s> the rents of wharfage dock and harbor room water power and many other privileges may be analyzed on similar principles <\s>
<s> take the case for example of a patent or exclusive privilege for the use of a process by which the cost of production is lessened <\s>
<s> if the value of the product continues to be regulated by what it costs to those who are obliged to persist in the old process the patentee will make an extra profit equal to the advantage which his process possesses over theirs <\s>

<s> of the second condition there are three classes 1 <\s>

<s> of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2 <\s>
<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>

<s> fisheries are another example <\s>

<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>

<s> of the second condition there are three classes 1 <\s>

<s> of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2 <\s>
<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>

<s> of the second condition there are three classes 1 <\s>

<s> of those whose supply is capable of indefinite increase their normal and permanent value is regulated by cost of production and their temporary or market value is regulated by demand and supply oscillating around cost of production which consists of the amount of labor and abstinence required <\s>
<s> of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2 <\s>
<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>

<s> of the second condition there are three classes 1 <\s>

<s> of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2 <\s>
<s> if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand <\s>
<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>
<s> rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a land tax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage <\s>
<s> the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit the laboring classes a whit through lowering the price to them or any consumer of food or agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent of mines and fisheries and ground rent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent <\s>
<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>
<s> but this is not true of all mines <\s>
<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>

<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>

<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>
<s> rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a land tax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage <\s>
<s> the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit the laboring classes a whit through lowering the price to them or any consumer of food or agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent of mines and fisheries and ground rent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent <\s>
<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>
<s> but this is not true of all mines <\s>
<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>
<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>
<s> we may take salmon fisheries as an example of the whole class <\s>
<s> some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others <\s>
<s> none however without being exhausted can supply more than a very limited demand <\s>
<s> all others therefore will if appropriated afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority <\s>
<s> both in the case of mines and of fisheries the natural order of events is liable to be interrupted by the opening of a new mine or a new fishery of superior quality to some of those already in use <\s>
<s> in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in usethe one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commoditywill be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>

<s> the three functions of moneya common denominator of value a medium of exchange a    standard of value    <\s>
<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
<s> thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion <\s>
<s> rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages <\s>
<s> if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it <\s>
<s> rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a land tax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage <\s>
<s> the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit the laboring classes a whit through lowering the price to them or any consumer of food or agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent of mines and fisheries and ground rent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent <\s>
<s> agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent <\s>
<s> mines are also an instance <\s>
<s> almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earthmetals coals precious stones etc    are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertilitythat is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital <\s>
<s> there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed <\s>
<s> but this is not true of all mines <\s>
<s> in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for <\s>
<s> in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production <\s>
<s> whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best <\s>
<s> all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess <\s>
<s> they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent <\s>
<s> mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do; and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse <\s>
<s> during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> fisheries are another example <\s>
<s> fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oyster beds or other particular fishing grounds on coasts <\s>
<s> we may take salmon fisheries as an example of the whole class <\s>
<s> some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others <\s>
<s> none however without being exhausted can supply more than a very limited demand <\s>
<s> all others therefore will if appropriated afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority <\s>
<s> both in the case of mines and of fisheries the natural order of events is liable to be interrupted by the opening of a new mine or a new fishery of superior quality to some of those already in use <\s>
<s> in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in usethe one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commoditywill be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain <\s>
<s> sites of remarkable beauty are generally limited in supply and therefore if in great demand are at a scarcity value <\s>
<s> sites superior only in convenience are governed as to their value by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> the ground rent of a house in a small village is but little higher than the rent of a similar patch of ground in the open fields <\s>
<s> suppose the various kinds of land to be represented by the alphabet that those below o pay no agricultural rent and that all lands increase in fertility and situation as we approach the beginning of the alphabet but which as far up as k are used in agriculture that higher than k all are more profitably used for building purposes viz a b c ... <\s>
<s> k l m n o ... <\s>
<s> now it will happen that land is chosen for building purposes irrespective of its fertility for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> it will not be true as some may think that no land will be used for building until it will pay a ground rent greater than the greatest agricultural rent paid by any piece of land <\s>
<s> it is not true for example if n be selected for a building lot that it must pay a ground rent as high as the agricultural rent of k the most fertile land cultivated in agriculture <\s>
<s> it must pay a ground rent higher only than it itself would pay if cultivated <\s>
<s> it is only necessary that it pay more than the same not better land would pay as rent if used only in agriculture <\s>
<s> the rents of wharfage dock and harbor room water power and many other privileges may be analyzed on similar principles <\s>
<s> take the case for example of a patent or exclusive privilege for the use of a process by which the cost of production is lessened <\s>
<s> if the value of the product continues to be regulated by what it costs to those who are obliged to persist in the old process the patentee will make an extra profit equal to the advantage which his process possesses over theirs <\s>
<s> this extra profit is essentially similar to rent and sometimes even assumes the form of it the patentee allowing to other producers the use of his privilege in consideration of an annual payment <\s>

<s> having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> as professor jevons 220 has pointed out money performs three distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and worthy of separate definition and explanation 1 <\s>
<s> a common measure or common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> a standard of value <\s>
<s> walker 221 however says    money is the medium of exchange <\s>
<s> whatever performs this function does this work is money no matter what it is made of .... <\s>
<s> that which does the money work is the money thing    1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts <\s>
<s> if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse <\s>
<s> the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value <\s>
<s> as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents <\s>
<s> the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that the inhabitants of the different states of the united states should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be communicated to the whole nation <\s>
<s> a man may have a horse whose value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of his house although he might not wish to sell either <\s>
<s> a valuation by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common denominator or register of value <\s>
<s> 2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the distinction between this function and the common denominator of value is that the latter measures value the former transfers value <\s>
<s> the man owning the horse after having measured its value by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for other things <\s>
<s> this discloses the need of another quality in money <\s>
<s> the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent <\s>
<s> a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided <\s>
<s> every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale <\s>
<s> the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping <\s>
<s> this reduces the choice to a small number of articles <\s>
<s> this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by professor jevons    some years since mademoiselle zlie a singer of the thtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round the world and gave a concert in the society islands <\s>
<s> in exchange for an air from    norma    and a few other songs she was to receive a third part of the receipts <\s>
<s> when counted her share was found to consist of three pigs twenty three turkeys forty four chickens five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of bananas lemons and oranges <\s>
<s> in the society islands however pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry with the fruit    222 3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed a    standard of value    it is perhaps better expressed by f <\s>
<s> walker 223 as a    standard of deferred payments    its existence is due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the contracts <\s>
<s> there is no distinction between this function and the first except one arising from the introduction of time <\s>
<s> at the same time and place the    standard of value    is given in the common denominator of value <\s>
<s> a measure of value 224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing <\s>
<s> when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another <\s>
<s> in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing <\s>
<s> to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated <\s>
<s> but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china <\s>
<s> to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in generalthat is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power <\s>
<s> now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true <\s>
<s> it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the only way in which a    standard of value    can be properly established is by the proposed    multiple standard of value    stated as follows    a number of articles in general usecorn beef potatoes wool cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and othersshall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard required <\s>
<s> the value of these articles in the quantities specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon officially promulgated <\s>
<s> persons may then if they choose make their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or tabular standard    225 a who had borrowed 1,000 of b in 1870 for ten years would make note of the total money value of all these articles composing the multiple standard which we will suppose is 125 in 1870 <\s>
<s> consequently a would promise to pay b eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or 1,000 <\s>
<s> but if other things change in value relatively to money during these ten years the same sum of money    1,000    in 1880 will not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he parted with in 1870 <\s>
