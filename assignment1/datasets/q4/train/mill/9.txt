<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> in one way or the other the increased population is provided for and all are as well off as before <\s>
<s> but if the growth of human power over nature is suspended or slackened and population does not slacken its increase if with only the existing command over natural agencies those agencies are called upon for an increased produce this greater produce will not be afforded to the increased population without either demanding on the average a greater effort from each or on the average reducing each to a smaller ration out of the aggregate produce <\s>
<s> ever since the great mechanical inventions of watt arkwright and their contemporaries the return to labor has probably increased as fast as the population and would even have outstripped it if that very augmentation of return had not called forth an additional portion of the inherent power of multiplication in the human species <\s>
<s> during the twenty or thirty years last elapsed so rapid has been the extension of improved processes of agriculture in england that even the land yields a greater produce in proportion to the labor employed the average price of corn had become decidedly lower even before the repeal of the corn laws had so materially lightened for the time being the pressure of population upon production <\s>

<s> as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor <\s>
<s> but the cost of the material forming generally a very small portion of the entire cost of the manufacture the agricultural labor concerned in the production of manufactured goods is but a small fraction of the whole labor worked up in the commodity <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>
<s> the benefit might even extend to the poorest class <\s>
<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>
<s> there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor <\s>
<s> nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect <\s>

<s> we may say the same of improvements in education <\s>
<s> the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence <\s>

<s> in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs <\s>
<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>

<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor <\s>
<s> but the cost of the material forming generally a very small portion of the entire cost of the manufacture the agricultural labor concerned in the production of manufactured goods is but a small fraction of the whole labor worked up in the commodity <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>
<s> the benefit might even extend to the poorest class <\s>
<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>
<s> there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor <\s>
<s> nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect <\s>
<s> improvements in government and almost every kind of moral and social advancement operate in the same manner <\s>
<s> we may say the same of improvements in education <\s>
<s> the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence <\s>
<s> friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so <\s>
<s> in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs <\s>
<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>
<s> when coal costs england as much as it does any other nation then her exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist <\s>
<s> in the united states the outlying iron deposits of lake superior lake champlain and pennsylvania so geologists tell us will find competition arising from the new grades of greater productiveness in the richer deposits of states like alabama <\s>
<s> in that case we shall be going from poorer to better grades of iron mines but after the change is made a series of different grades of productiveness will be established as before <\s>
<s> to resume all natural agents which are limited in quantity are not only limited in their ultimate productive power but long before that power is stretched to the utmost they yield to any additional demands on progressively harder terms <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>

<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>
<s> the benefit might even extend to the poorest class <\s>
<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>
<s> there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor <\s>
<s> nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect <\s>
<s> improvements in government and almost every kind of moral and social advancement operate in the same manner <\s>
<s> we may say the same of improvements in education <\s>
<s> the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence <\s>
<s> friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so <\s>
<s> in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs <\s>
<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>
<s> when coal costs england as much as it does any other nation then her exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist <\s>
<s> in the united states the outlying iron deposits of lake superior lake champlain and pennsylvania so geologists tell us will find competition arising from the new grades of greater productiveness in the richer deposits of states like alabama <\s>

<s> to resume all natural agents which are limited in quantity are not only limited in their ultimate productive power but long before that power is stretched to the utmost they yield to any additional demands on progressively harder terms <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>

<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>

<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>

<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>

<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor <\s>
<s> but the cost of the material forming generally a very small portion of the entire cost of the manufacture the agricultural labor concerned in the production of manufactured goods is but a small fraction of the whole labor worked up in the commodity <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>
<s> the benefit might even extend to the poorest class <\s>
<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>
<s> there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor <\s>
<s> nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect <\s>
<s> improvements in government and almost every kind of moral and social advancement operate in the same manner <\s>
<s> we may say the same of improvements in education <\s>
<s> the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence <\s>
<s> friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so <\s>
<s> in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs <\s>
<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>
<s> when coal costs england as much as it does any other nation then her exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist <\s>
<s> in the united states the outlying iron deposits of lake superior lake champlain and pennsylvania so geologists tell us will find competition arising from the new grades of greater productiveness in the richer deposits of states like alabama <\s>
<s> in that case we shall be going from poorer to better grades of iron mines but after the change is made a series of different grades of productiveness will be established as before <\s>
<s> to resume all natural agents which are limited in quantity are not only limited in their ultimate productive power but long before that power is stretched to the utmost they yield to any additional demands on progressively harder terms <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>

<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>
<s> the benefit might even extend to the poorest class <\s>
<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>
<s> there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor <\s>
<s> nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect <\s>
<s> improvements in government and almost every kind of moral and social advancement operate in the same manner <\s>
<s> we may say the same of improvements in education <\s>
<s> the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence <\s>
<s> friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so <\s>
<s> in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs <\s>
<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>
<s> when coal costs england as much as it does any other nation then her exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist <\s>
<s> in the united states the outlying iron deposits of lake superior lake champlain and pennsylvania so geologists tell us will find competition arising from the new grades of greater productiveness in the richer deposits of states like alabama <\s>

<s> to resume all natural agents which are limited in quantity are not only limited in their ultimate productive power but long before that power is stretched to the utmost they yield to any additional demands on progressively harder terms <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>

<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>

<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>

<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>

<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor <\s>
<s> but the cost of the material forming generally a very small portion of the entire cost of the manufacture the agricultural labor concerned in the production of manufactured goods is but a small fraction of the whole labor worked up in the commodity <\s>

<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>
<s> the benefit might even extend to the poorest class <\s>
<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>
<s> there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor <\s>
<s> nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect <\s>
<s> improvements in government and almost every kind of moral and social advancement operate in the same manner <\s>
<s> we may say the same of improvements in education <\s>
<s> the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence <\s>
<s> friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so <\s>
<s> in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs <\s>
<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>
<s> when coal costs england as much as it does any other nation then her exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist <\s>
<s> in the united states the outlying iron deposits of lake superior lake champlain and pennsylvania so geologists tell us will find competition arising from the new grades of greater productiveness in the richer deposits of states like alabama <\s>
<s> in that case we shall be going from poorer to better grades of iron mines but after the change is made a series of different grades of productiveness will be established as before <\s>
<s> to resume all natural agents which are limited in quantity are not only limited in their ultimate productive power but long before that power is stretched to the utmost they yield to any additional demands on progressively harder terms <\s>

<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>

<s> europe has one mile to each 3,000 inhabitants if russia be included about one mile to each 2,540 exclusive of russia the materials of manufactures being all drawn from the land and many of them from agriculture which supplies in particular the entire material of clothing the general law of production from the land the law of diminishing return must in the last resort be applicable to manufacturing as well as to agricultural history <\s>
<s> as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor <\s>
<s> but the cost of the material forming generally a very small portion of the entire cost of the manufacture the agricultural labor concerned in the production of manufactured goods is but a small fraction of the whole labor worked up in the commodity <\s>
<s> babbage 137 gives an interesting illustration of this principle <\s>
<s> bar iron of the value of   1 became worth when manufactured into      slit iron for nails 1.10 natural steel 1.42 horseshoes 2.55 gun barrels ordinary 9.10 wood saws 14.28 scissors best 446.94 penknife blades 657.14 sword handles polished steel 972.82 it can not however be said of such manufactures as coarse cotton cloth wherein the increased cost of raw cotton causes an immediate effect upon the price of the cloth that the cost of the materials forms but a small portion of the cost of the manufacture 138 all the labor not engaged in preparing materials tends constantly and strongly toward diminution as the amount of production increases <\s>
<s> manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor <\s>
<s> in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost <\s>
<s> this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify <\s>
<s> the benefit might even extend to the poorest class <\s>
<s> the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food <\s>
<s> there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor <\s>
<s> nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect <\s>
<s> improvements in government and almost every kind of moral and social advancement operate in the same manner <\s>
<s> we may say the same of improvements in education <\s>
<s> the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence <\s>
<s> friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so <\s>
<s> in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs <\s>
<s> law holds true of mining <\s>
<s> we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe <\s>
<s> mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense <\s>
<s> it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree <\s>
<s> mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steam engine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted <\s>
<s> there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness <\s>
<s> professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial situation of england 139 while explaining that the supply of cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost <\s>
<s> when coal costs england as much as it does any other nation then her exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist <\s>
<s> in the united states the outlying iron deposits of lake superior lake champlain and pennsylvania so geologists tell us will find competition arising from the new grades of greater productiveness in the richer deposits of states like alabama <\s>
<s> in that case we shall be going from poorer to better grades of iron mines but after the change is made a series of different grades of productiveness will be established as before <\s>
<s> to resume all natural agents which are limited in quantity are not only limited in their ultimate productive power but long before that power is stretched to the utmost they yield to any additional demands on progressively harder terms <\s>
<s> this law may however be suspended or temporarily controlled by whatever adds to the general power of mankind over nature and especially by any extension of their knowledge and their consequent command of the properties and powers of natural agents <\s>
<s> consequences of the foregoing laws <\s>
<s> remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land <\s>
<s> production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence <\s>
<s> in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert <\s>
<s> secondly improvement of the public intelligence <\s>
<s> thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation <\s>
<s> an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently drawn of late <\s>
<s> all these proposed remedies if put into use in mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth <\s>
<s> even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land <\s>
<s> but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement <\s>
<s> in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns <\s>
<s> it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land <\s>
<s> this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation <\s>
<s> if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the given country is an influence which works against the tendency <\s>
<s> yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever working <\s>
<s> in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual <\s>
<s> an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion <\s>
<s> the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts <\s>
<s> whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old <\s>
<s> from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property <\s>
<s> a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller <\s>
<s> the niggardliness of nature 140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to over population <\s>
<s> an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands <\s>
<s> the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much <\s>
<s> after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort <\s>
<s> improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production <\s>
<s> the increase in the population of the united states has been enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen by the following table amounts in the second column are given in millions 141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth goes on faster than the increase of population so that it manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant <\s>

<s> in one way or the other the increased population is provided for and all are as well off as before <\s>
<s> but if the growth of human power over nature is suspended or slackened and population does not slacken its increase if with only the existing command over natural agencies those agencies are called upon for an increased produce this greater produce will not be afforded to the increased population without either demanding on the average a greater effort from each or on the average reducing each to a smaller ration out of the aggregate produce <\s>
<s> ever since the great mechanical inventions of watt arkwright and their contemporaries the return to labor has probably increased as fast as the population and would even have outstripped it if that very augmentation of return had not called forth an additional portion of the inherent power of multiplication in the human species <\s>
<s> during the twenty or thirty years last elapsed so rapid has been the extension of improved processes of agriculture in england that even the land yields a greater produce in proportion to the labor employed the average price of corn had become decidedly lower even before the repeal of the corn laws had so materially lightened for the time being the pressure of population upon production <\s>
