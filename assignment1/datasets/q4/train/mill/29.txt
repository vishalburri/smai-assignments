<s> first let us suppose that the quantity of commodities produced is not greater than the community would be glad to consume is it in that case possible that there should be a deficiency of demand for all commodities for want of the means of payment <\s>
<s> those who think so can not have considered what it is which constitutes the means of payment for commodities <\s>
<s> it is simply commodities <\s>
<s> each persons means of paying for the productions of other people consists of those which he himself possesses <\s>

<s> here it will be said is over production <\s>
<s> true i reply over production of that particular article <\s>

<s> if he could not produce something capable of exciting a new want or desire in the community for the satisfaction of which some one would grow more food and give it to him in exchange he had the alternative of growing food for himself either on fresh land if there was any unoccupied or as a tenant or partner or servant of some former occupier willing to be partially relieved from labor <\s>
<s> he has produced a thing not wanted instead of what was wanted and he himself perhaps is not the kind of producer who is wantedbut there is no over production production is not excessive but merely ill assorted <\s>
<s> we saw before that whoever brings additional commodities to the market brings an additional power of purchase we now see that he brings also an additional desire to consume since if he had not that desire he would not have troubled himself to produce <\s>

<s> so far as we know man it does not seem possible that there will ever be a falling off in demand because of a satiety of all material satisfactions <\s>
<s> origin and explanation of the notion of general over supply <\s>
<s> i have already described the state of the markets for commodities which accompanies what is termed a commercial crisis <\s>
<s> at such times there is really an excess of all commodities above the money demand in other words there is an under supply of money <\s>
<s> from the sudden annihilation of a great mass of credit every one dislikes to part with ready money and many are anxious to procure it at any sacrifice <\s>
<s> almost everybody therefore is a seller and there are scarcely any buyers so that there may really be though only while the crisis lasts an extreme depression of general prices from what may be indiscriminately called a glut of commodities or a dearth of money <\s>
<s> but it is a great error to suppose with sismondi that a commercial crisis is the effect of a general excess of production <\s>
<s> it is simply the consequence of an excess of speculative purchases <\s>
<s> it is not a gradual advent of low prices but a sudden recoil from prices extravagantly high its immediate cause is a contraction of credit and the remedy is not a diminution of supply but the restoration of confidence <\s>
<s> it is also evident that this temporary derangement of markets is an evil only because it is temporary <\s>
<s> the fall being solely of money prices if prices did not rise again no dealer would lose since the smaller price would be worth as much to him as the larger price was before <\s>
<s> in no matter does this phenomenon answer to the description which these celebrated economists have given of the evil of over production <\s>
<s> that permanent decline in the circumstances of producers for want of markets which those writers contemplate is a conception to which the nature of a commercial crisis gives no support <\s>
<s> the other phenomenon from which the notion of a general excess of wealth and superfluity of accumulation seems to derive countenance is one of a more permanent nature namely the fall of profits and interest which naturally takes place with the progress of population and production <\s>
<s> the cause of this decline of profit is the increased cost of maintaining labor which results from an increase of population and of the demand for food outstripping the advance of agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> this important feature in the economical progress of nations will receive full consideration and discussion in the succeeding book 256 it is obviously a totally different thing from a want of market for commodities though often confounded with it in the complaints of the producing and trading classes <\s>
<s> the true interpretation of the modern or present state of industrial economy is that there is hardly any amount of business which may not be done if people will be content to do it on small profits and this all active and intelligent persons in business perfectly well know but even those who comply with the necessities of their time grumble at what they comply with and wish that there were less capital 257 or as they express it less competition in order that there might be greater profits <\s>
<s> low profits however are a different thing from deficiency of demand and the production and accumulation which merely reduce profits can not be called excess of supply or of production <\s>
<s> what the phenomenon really is and its effects and necessary limits will be seen when we treat of that express subject <\s>
<s> of some peculiar cases of value <\s>
<s> values of commodities which have a joint cost of production <\s>
<s> the general laws of value in all the more important cases of the interchange of commodities in the same country have now been investigated <\s>
<s> we examined first the case of monopoly in which the value is determined by either a natural or an artificial limitation of quantity that is by demand and supply secondly the case of free competition when the article can be produced in indefinite quantity at the same cost in which case the permanent value is determined by the cost of production and only the fluctuations by supply and demand thirdly a mixed case that of the articles which can be produced in indefinite quantity but not at the same cost in which case the permanent value is determined by the greatest cost which it is necessary to incur in order to obtain the required supply and lastly we have found that money itself is a commodity of the third class that its value in a state of freedom is governed by the same laws as the values of other commodities of its class and that prices therefore follow the same laws as values <\s>
<s> from this it appears that demand and supply govern the fluctuations of values and prices in all cases and the permanent values and prices of all things of which the supply is determined by any agency other than that of free competition but that under the r  gime of competition things are on the average exchanged for each other at such values and sold at such prices as afford equal expectation of advantage to all classes of producers which can only be when things exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production <\s>
<s> here again is a distinct recognition of the true meaning of cost of production and its ruling influence within a competing group which has been seen in its full significance by mr <\s>
<s> it sometimes happens however that two different commodities have what may be termed a joint cost of production <\s>
<s> they are both products of the same operation or set of operations and the outlay is incurred for the sake of both together not part for one and part for the other <\s>
<s> the same outlay would have to be incurred for either of the two if the other were not wanted or used at all <\s>
<s> this seller has obtained for his commodity only the accustomed quantity of money while there are already some things of which that money will no longer purchase as much as before <\s>
<s> if therefore he knows what is going on he will raise his price and then the buyer will not have the gain which is supposed to stimulate his industry <\s>

<s> when these writers speak of the supply of commodities as outrunning the demand it is not clear which of the two elements of demand they have in viewthe desire to possess or the means of purchase whether their meaning is that there are in such cases more consumable products in existence than the public desires to consume or merely more than it is able to pay for <\s>

<s> it is simply commodities <\s>
<s> each persons means of paying for the productions of other people consists of those which he himself possesses <\s>

<s> although the community would willingly double its aggregate consumption it may already have as much as it desires of some commodities and it may prefer to do more than double its consumption of others or to exercise its increased purchasing power on some new thing <\s>

<s> assume the most favorable hypothesis for the purpose that of a limited community every member of which possesses as much of necessaries and of all known luxuries as he desires and since it is not conceivable that persons whose wants were completely satisfied would labor and economize to obtain what they did not desire suppose that a foreigner arrives and produces an additional quantity of something of which there was already enough <\s>
<s> here it will be said is over production <\s>
<s> true i reply over production of that particular article <\s>

<s> the old inhabitants indeed wanted nothing but did not the foreigner himself want something <\s>
<s> when he produced the superfluous article was he laboring without a motive <\s>

<s> if he could not produce something capable of exciting a new want or desire in the community for the satisfaction of which some one would grow more food and give it to him in exchange he had the alternative of growing food for himself either on fresh land if there was any unoccupied or as a tenant or partner or servant of some former occupier willing to be partially relieved from labor <\s>
<s> he has produced a thing not wanted instead of what was wanted and he himself perhaps is not the kind of producer who is wantedbut there is no over production production is not excessive but merely ill assorted <\s>
<s> we saw before that whoever brings additional commodities to the market brings an additional power of purchase we now see that he brings also an additional desire to consume since if he had not that desire he would not have troubled himself to produce <\s>

<s> so far as we know man it does not seem possible that there will ever be a falling off in demand because of a satiety of all material satisfactions <\s>
<s> origin and explanation of the notion of general over supply <\s>
<s> i have already described the state of the markets for commodities which accompanies what is termed a commercial crisis <\s>
<s> at such times there is really an excess of all commodities above the money demand in other words there is an under supply of money <\s>
<s> from the sudden annihilation of a great mass of credit every one dislikes to part with ready money and many are anxious to procure it at any sacrifice <\s>
<s> almost everybody therefore is a seller and there are scarcely any buyers so that there may really be though only while the crisis lasts an extreme depression of general prices from what may be indiscriminately called a glut of commodities or a dearth of money <\s>
<s> but it is a great error to suppose with sismondi that a commercial crisis is the effect of a general excess of production <\s>
<s> it is simply the consequence of an excess of speculative purchases <\s>
<s> it is not a gradual advent of low prices but a sudden recoil from prices extravagantly high its immediate cause is a contraction of credit and the remedy is not a diminution of supply but the restoration of confidence <\s>
<s> it is also evident that this temporary derangement of markets is an evil only because it is temporary <\s>
<s> the fall being solely of money prices if prices did not rise again no dealer would lose since the smaller price would be worth as much to him as the larger price was before <\s>
<s> in no matter does this phenomenon answer to the description which these celebrated economists have given of the evil of over production <\s>
<s> that permanent decline in the circumstances of producers for want of markets which those writers contemplate is a conception to which the nature of a commercial crisis gives no support <\s>
<s> the other phenomenon from which the notion of a general excess of wealth and superfluity of accumulation seems to derive countenance is one of a more permanent nature namely the fall of profits and interest which naturally takes place with the progress of population and production <\s>
<s> the cause of this decline of profit is the increased cost of maintaining labor which results from an increase of population and of the demand for food outstripping the advance of agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> this important feature in the economical progress of nations will receive full consideration and discussion in the succeeding book 256 it is obviously a totally different thing from a want of market for commodities though often confounded with it in the complaints of the producing and trading classes <\s>
<s> the true interpretation of the modern or present state of industrial economy is that there is hardly any amount of business which may not be done if people will be content to do it on small profits and this all active and intelligent persons in business perfectly well know but even those who comply with the necessities of their time grumble at what they comply with and wish that there were less capital 257 or as they express it less competition in order that there might be greater profits <\s>
<s> low profits however are a different thing from deficiency of demand and the production and accumulation which merely reduce profits can not be called excess of supply or of production <\s>
<s> what the phenomenon really is and its effects and necessary limits will be seen when we treat of that express subject <\s>
<s> of some peculiar cases of value <\s>
<s> values of commodities which have a joint cost of production <\s>
<s> the general laws of value in all the more important cases of the interchange of commodities in the same country have now been investigated <\s>
<s> we examined first the case of monopoly in which the value is determined by either a natural or an artificial limitation of quantity that is by demand and supply secondly the case of free competition when the article can be produced in indefinite quantity at the same cost in which case the permanent value is determined by the cost of production and only the fluctuations by supply and demand thirdly a mixed case that of the articles which can be produced in indefinite quantity but not at the same cost in which case the permanent value is determined by the greatest cost which it is necessary to incur in order to obtain the required supply and lastly we have found that money itself is a commodity of the third class that its value in a state of freedom is governed by the same laws as the values of other commodities of its class and that prices therefore follow the same laws as values <\s>
<s> from this it appears that demand and supply govern the fluctuations of values and prices in all cases and the permanent values and prices of all things of which the supply is determined by any agency other than that of free competition but that under the r  gime of competition things are on the average exchanged for each other at such values and sold at such prices as afford equal expectation of advantage to all classes of producers which can only be when things exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production <\s>
<s> here again is a distinct recognition of the true meaning of cost of production and its ruling influence within a competing group which has been seen in its full significance by mr <\s>
<s> it sometimes happens however that two different commodities have what may be termed a joint cost of production <\s>
<s> they are both products of the same operation or set of operations and the outlay is incurred for the sake of both together not part for one and part for the other <\s>
<s> the same outlay would have to be incurred for either of the two if the other were not wanted or used at all <\s>
<s> this seller has obtained for his commodity only the accustomed quantity of money while there are already some things of which that money will no longer purchase as much as before <\s>
<s> if therefore he knows what is going on he will raise his price and then the buyer will not have the gain which is supposed to stimulate his industry <\s>
<s> but if on the contrary the seller does not know the state of the case and only discovers it when he finds in laying his money out that it does not go so far he then obtains less than the ordinary remuneration for his labor and capital and if the other dealers industry is encouraged it should seem that his must from the opposite cause be impaired <\s>
<s> an issue of notes is a manifest gain to the issuers who until the notes are returned for payment obtain the use of them as if they were a real capital and so long as the notes are no permanent addition to the currency but merely supersede gold or silver to the same amount the gain of the issuer is a loss to no one it is obtained by saving to the community the expense of the more costly material <\s>
<s> but if there is no gold or silver to be supersededif the notes are added to the currency instead of being substituted for the metallic part of itall holders of currency lose by the depreciation of its value the exact equivalent of what the issuer gains <\s>
<s> a tax is virtually levied on them for his benefit <\s>
<s> but besides the benefit reaped by the issuers or by others through them at the expense of the public generally there is another unjust gain obtained by a larger classnamely by those who are under fixed pecuniary obligations <\s>
