<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>

<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>

<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>

<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>

<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>

<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>

<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>

<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>

<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>

<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>

<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>

<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>

<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>

<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>

<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>

<s> the circumstance which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being transported from place to placethat is to say their portableness   depending as it does partly on their durability and partly on their bulk    it is found that taking timber and meat as a typeone possessing portableness in a vastly greater degree than the otherin the early settlement of a new country the portable article like timber at once rises in price    to a level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost of transport    on the other hand perishable articles like meat are    confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the early stages of their growth is necessarily low <\s>
<s> but as population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural pasture lands originally available for the rearing of cattle still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises    as population increases there will be an increased demand for dairy products eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near populous centers for such perishable products than for the products of large farming <\s>
<s> almost every one who knows the high prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared with their prices in country districts is familiar with the phenomena which illustrate this principle <\s>
<s> moreover as a denser population settles on our western prairies now given over to ranches and vast pasturing grounds for cattlesince cattle in general require a large extent of landthe cost of meat will rise <\s>
<s> the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be kept down by the force of competition from other distant places as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and wool <\s>
<s> what has been said of the transportableness of meat however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator cars but there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a type <\s>
<s> no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles <\s>
<s> the tendency is in the contrary direction <\s>
<s> the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed <\s>
<s> as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture <\s>
<s> but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit <\s>
<s> it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall <\s>
<s> money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price <\s>
<s> the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion <\s>
<s> in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be remarked    that as the course of price in the field of raw products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite direction <\s>
<s> the reasons of this are exceedingly plain <\s>
<s> in the first place division of laborthe first and most powerful of all cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive industry but very limited scopefinds in manufacturing industry an almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal success <\s>
<s> it follows at once from these facts taken in connection with the further fact that industrial invention does not take place per saltum but graduallyone invention ever treading on the heels of anotherand that its advance seems to be subject to no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of society undergo constant diminution .... <\s>
<s> in all the great branches of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one knows great and unremitting in its action    as has been said    the two great cheapeners of production are division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on <\s>
<s> those manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with the progress of society will be most marked <\s>
<s> but the manufactures which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which there exists the largest demandthat is to say are those which enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of people <\s>
<s> they are also i may add those in which a fall in price is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand <\s>
<s> all the common kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of cheapening    but the articles of common consumption are those in which    the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the more elaborate manufactures <\s>
<s> such coarser manufactures therefore would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material more sensibly than the refined sorts <\s>
<s> nevertheless it can not be supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts <\s>
<s> it is in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results of the same kind      4 <\s>
<s>    that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production <\s>
<s> whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agenciesincrease of population and improvement in agricultural skill <\s>
<s> in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary <\s>
<s> in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement <\s>
<s> such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 <\s>
<s> in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement <\s>
<s> in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence <\s>
<s> moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic markets <\s>
<s> and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits <\s>
<s> but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent <\s>
<s> real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states <\s>
<s> we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of society on production and distribution <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices <\s>
<s> tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of co operation <\s>
<s> in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generationa progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity <\s>
<s> all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career <\s>
<s> it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices <\s>
<s> of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of mans power over nature <\s>
<s> our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy <\s>
<s> another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property <\s>
<s> of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation <\s>
<s> industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy <\s>
<s> one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind <\s>
<s> i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly <\s>
<s> what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action <\s>
<s> works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the half civilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake <\s>
<s> the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of co operation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action <\s>
<s> this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment <\s>
<s> that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend <\s>
<s> it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation <\s>
<s> we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as long continued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation <\s>
<s> tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities <\s>
<s> the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities <\s>
<s> the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production <\s>
<s> 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production <\s>
<s> all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity <\s>
<s> as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values <\s>
<s> as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals <\s>
<s> if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to moneythat is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world <\s>
<s> but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would <\s>
<s> as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850 there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in greater proportion than the need arising from increased transactions <\s>
<s> this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted to be true of gold as late as about 1865 <\s>
<s> it has been asserted by mr <\s>
<s> goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated <\s>
<s> an appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices <\s>
<s> on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated <\s>
<s> prices even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to 1879 were not quite so low as in 1845 1850 as is seen by the following table taken from the london    economist       2,200 indicating the price of a given number of articles in 1845 1850 as the basis of the table with which the prices of other years are compared year <\s>
<s> 1845 1850 2,200 1857 july 1 2,996 1858 january 1 2,612 1865 3,575 1866 3,564 1867 3,024 1868 2,682 1869 2,666 1870 2,689 1871 2,590 1872 2,835 1873 2,947 1874 depression 2,891 1875 depression 2,778 1876 depression 2,711 1877 depression 2,723 1878 depression 2,529 1879 depression 2,202 1880 2,538 1881 2,376 1882 2,435 1883 2,343 but the progress of society particularly in the direction of improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common consumption <\s>
<s> the process has been already seen in the diminished charge for railway transportation see chart no <\s>
<s> moreover the years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening goes on at its best <\s>
<s> hence if prices have had a tendency to fall owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on improvementsand if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850   it shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great gold production of this century <\s>
<s> and even the access to more fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the fact that prices have not fallen as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from being fully seen <\s>
<s> improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities <\s>
<s> 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world <\s>
<s> as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind <\s>
<s> 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries <\s>
<s> much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on <\s>
<s> from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost <\s>
<s>    except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise <\s>
<s> are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement <\s>
<s> we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking <\s>
<s> the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase <\s>
<s> this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves <\s>
<s> if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production 295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores <\s>
<s> when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases c  teris paribus with every increase of the demand <\s>
<s> cairnes has made some essential contributions to the discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of society :( 296    when a colony establishes itself in a new country the course of its industrial development naturally follows the character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by the environment <\s>
<s> these will of course vary a good deal according to the part of the world in which the new society happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into some one or more of those branches of industry which have been conveniently designated    extractive    agriculture pastoral and mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the principal of such industries    to these pursuits apply    that law of political economy or more properly of physical nature which mr <\s>
<s> mill has rightly characterized as the most important proposition in economic sciencethe law as he phrased it of    diminishing productiveness    it may be thus briefly stated in any given state of the arts of production the returns to human industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of yielding but after this point has been passed though an increased application of labor and capital will obtain an increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased return on the contrary every further increase of outlayalways assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same as beforewill be attended with a return constantly diminishing .... <\s>
<s> what i am now concerned to show is the manner in which with the progress of society the law in question affects the course of normal 297 values in all commodities coming under its influence <\s>
<s>    the class of commodities in the production of which the facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool game furs hides horns pitch resin etc <\s>
