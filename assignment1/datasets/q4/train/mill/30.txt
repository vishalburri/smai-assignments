<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>

<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>
<s> let us suppose that this number is 1,000 times seventeen yards <\s>
<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>
<s> even if woolen cloth could be made cheaper in england than in the united states we know that neither capital nor labor would easily leave the united states for england although it might go from rhode island to massachusetts under similar inducements <\s>
<s> if shoes can be made with less advantage in providence than in lynn the shoe industry will come to lynn but it does not follow that the english shoe industry would come to lynn even if the advantages of the latter were greater than those in england <\s>
<s> if there be no obstacle to the free movement of labor and capital between places or occupations and if some place or occupation can produce at a less cost than another place or occupation then there will be a migration of the instruments of production <\s>
<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>
<s> when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of international values becomes very simple <\s>
<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>

<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>

<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>

<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>

<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>

<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>

<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>
<s> let us suppose that this number is 1,000 times seventeen yards <\s>
<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>

<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>

<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>

<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> if there be no obstacle to the free movement of labor and capital between places or occupations and if some place or occupation can produce at a less cost than another place or occupation then there will be a migration of the instruments of production <\s>
<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>
<s> when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of international values becomes very simple <\s>
<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>
<s> when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of international values becomes very simple <\s>
<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>

<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>

<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>

<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>

<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>

<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>
<s> let us suppose that this number is 1,000 times seventeen yards <\s>
<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>

<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>

<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>

<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> if there be no obstacle to the free movement of labor and capital between places or occupations and if some place or occupation can produce at a less cost than another place or occupation then there will be a migration of the instruments of production <\s>
<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>
<s> when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of international values becomes very simple <\s>
<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>
<s> when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of international values becomes very simple <\s>
<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>

<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>

<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>

<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>

<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>

<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>
<s> let us suppose that this number is 1,000 times seventeen yards <\s>
<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>

<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>

<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>

<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> if there be no obstacle to the free movement of labor and capital between places or occupations and if some place or occupation can produce at a less cost than another place or occupation then there will be a migration of the instruments of production <\s>
<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>
<s> when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of international values becomes very simple <\s>
<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> since there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that of two    non competing groups    within the same country as before explained <\s>
<s> when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of international values becomes very simple <\s>
<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>

<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>

<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>

<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>

<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>

<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>

<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>
<s> we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty <\s>
<s> the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> it has been previously explained that the conditions called <\s>
<s>    international    are those either within a nation or those existing between two separate nations which are such as to prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of industries to another or from one locality to another distant one <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>

<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>

<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>

<s> it does not differ from the question of those domestic values for which we found 269 that the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present inquiry <\s>
<s> it is not here a question as to what causes international trade between two countries that has been treated in the preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the comparative cost <\s>
<s> the question now is one of exchange value that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will exchange <\s>
<s> the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions of the exchange <\s>
<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>

<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>

<s> why does one article exchange for more or less of another <\s>
<s> not as we have seen because one costs more or less to produce than the other <\s>
<s> in the trade between the united states and england in iron and corn formerly referred to p <\s>
<s> 383 it was seen that a 100 days    labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the united states 125 days    labor <\s>
<s> england sends 150 days    labor of iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost her 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> but what rule fixes the proportions between 100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for england at which the exchanges will take place <\s>
<s> the trade increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio will the two countries share this gain <\s>
<s> the answer is briefly in the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of the two countries respectively for iron and corn <\s>
<s> this however may be capable of explanation in a simple form <\s>
<s> a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to get the article belonging to the other <\s>
<s> will a give one spade for one bushel of oats or for two <\s>
<s> will b give two bushels of oats for one spade <\s>
<s> that depends upon how strong a desire a has for oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two spades for one bushel <\s>
<s> but the exchange also depends upon b <\s>
<s> if he has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger exchange value <\s>
<s> if on the other hand a cares less for oats than b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased value of spades relatively to oats <\s>
<s> when two commodities exchange against each other their exchange values will depend entirely upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the other commodity <\s>
<s> and this simple form of the statement of reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international values <\s>
<s> if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let the trade be between england and the united states the quantity of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states for iron <\s>
<s> something may cut off englands demand for our breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices will fall <\s>
<s> but if on the other hand england has poor harvests and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will rise in value <\s>
<s> and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to 1879 <\s>
<s> now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days    labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of english iron <\s>
<s> that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands of the two countries for corn and iron respectively <\s>
<s> moreover it will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two countries together with their means of purchase <\s>
<s> but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards their extreme limits <\s>
<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>
<s> let us suppose that this number is 1,000 times seventeen yards <\s>
<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
<s> if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable <\s>

<s> the reciprocal demand can not carry the exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost of production of the article <\s>
<s> for instance an urgent need in england for corn if the united states has a light demand for english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such that england will offer so much more than 150 days    labor in iron for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days    labor in iron <\s>
<s> it will be seen at once then if that were the case that england would produce the corn herself and that she would then have no gain whatever from the trade <\s>
<s> the ratio of exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side to the cost of production 200 days    labor of english corn <\s>
<s> on the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united states had a great demand for iron but england had little need for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days    labor of corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor we could produce the iron ourselves <\s>
<s> in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in corn and iron only <\s>
<s> if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states the conclusions would be exactly the same <\s>
<s> the ratios of a myriad of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand exchanging against each other give a general result by which the goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the goods <\s>
<s> goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends on reciprocal demand and supply <\s>
<s> if we now add more countries to the example we simply increase the number of persons although in different countries wanting our goods as set off against our demands for the goods of this greater number of persons <\s>
<s> if france germany and england all want our corn we must have some demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange <\s>
<s> that this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect their exchange value or price <\s>
<s> when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states <\s>
<s> but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side <\s>
<s> who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states <\s>
<s> that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods <\s>
<s> no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same <\s>
<s> it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited <\s>
<s> this would depend on the play of international demand <\s>
<s> cost of carriage has one effect more <\s>
<s> but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported <\s>
<s> a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries <\s>
<s> but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself <\s>
<s> after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another <\s>
<s> this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic <\s>
<s>    as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany <\s>
<s> mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen as follows    suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty    this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england <\s>
<s>    when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany <\s>
<s> they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both <\s>
<s> if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all <\s>
<s> if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit <\s>
<s> if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries <\s>
<s> if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty <\s>
<s> the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other <\s>
<s> let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s>    the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price <\s>
<s> in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price <\s>
<s> there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand <\s>
<s> let us suppose this quantity to be 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s>    let us now turn our attention to england <\s>
<s> there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s> there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more <\s>
<s> let us suppose that this number is 1,000 times seventeen yards <\s>
<s>    as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1,000 times seventeen yards to 1,000 times ten yards <\s>
<s> at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires <\s>
<s> the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other <\s>
<s> the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth <\s>
<s>    but our suppositions might have been different <\s>
<s> suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1,000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value <\s>
<s> germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price <\s>
<s> to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen <\s>
<s> at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen <\s>
<s> she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards <\s>
<s> on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished <\s>
<s> if instead of 1,000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen <\s>
<s>    the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1,200 times seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen <\s>
<s> by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration      4 <\s>
