<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>

<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>

<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>

<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>

<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>

<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>

<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>

<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>

<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>

<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>

<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>

<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>

<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>

<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>

<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>

<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>

<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>

<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>

<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>
<s> the quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity of labor to be employed <\s>
<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>
<s> i contained an extended argument to show that demand and supply i e the proportion between wages fund and laborers did not regulate wages and denied the existence of a predetermined wages fund fixed in amount <\s>
<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>

<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>

<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>

<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>

<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>
<s> the quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity of labor to be employed <\s>
<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>

<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>

<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>

<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>

<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>

<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>

<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>

<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>

<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>

<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>

<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>

<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>

<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>

<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>
<s> the quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity of labor to be employed <\s>
<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>

<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>

<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>

<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>

<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>

<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>

<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>

<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>

<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>

<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>
<s> i contained an extended argument to show that demand and supply i e the proportion between wages fund and laborers did not regulate wages and denied the existence of a predetermined wages fund fixed in amount <\s>
<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>

<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>

<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>

<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>
<s> the quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity of labor to be employed <\s>
<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>
<s> i contained an extended argument to show that demand and supply i e the proportion between wages fund and laborers did not regulate wages and denied the existence of a predetermined wages fund fixed in amount <\s>
<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>

<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>

<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>

<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>

<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>

<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>

<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>

<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>
<s> the quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity of labor to be employed <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>

<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>

<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>

<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>
<s> an increase of circle a by a larger production makes possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged or not depends on the principle of accumulation <\s>
<s> the larger the total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has given us a solution of the real question at issue <\s>
<s> the larger the house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not follow that the rooms will be necessarily largeas any inmate of a summer hotel will testify <\s>
<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>

<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>

<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>

<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>

<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>

<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>

<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>

<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>
<s>    it is the prospect of a profit in production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he can pay him    p <\s>
<s> no doubt wages can be and often are paid out of the current product but what amount <\s>
<s> what is the principle of distribution <\s>
<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>

<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>

<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>

<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>

<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>
<s> the quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity of labor to be employed <\s>
<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>
<s> i contained an extended argument to show that demand and supply i e the proportion between wages fund and laborers did not regulate wages and denied the existence of a predetermined wages fund fixed in amount <\s>
<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>
<s> in order to make good investments a certain amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the payment of labor 162 mr <\s>
<s> thorntons argument attracted the more attention because mr <\s>
<s> mill 163 admitted that mr <\s>
<s> thornton had induced him to abandon his wages fund theory <\s>
<s> the subject was however taken up re examined by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 164 and stated in a truer form <\s>
<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
<s> how much capital will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap <\s>
<s> the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on the character of the people <\s>
<s> the wages fund then depends ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b <\s>
<s> it can never be larger than b <\s>
<s> so far at least its amount is    predetermined    in the economic sense by general laws regarding the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit <\s>
<s> circle b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers <\s>
<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>
<s> the nature of the industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less share of capital will be spent in wages <\s>
<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>

<s> 2 another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of the arts of production <\s>
<s> in production the particular conditions of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to a given machine for a given amount of material <\s>
<s> with some kinds of hand made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery and tools <\s>
<s> in many branches of agriculture and small farming this holds true <\s>
<s> the converse however is true in many manufactures where machinery is largely used <\s>
<s> no two industries will maintain the same proportion between the three elements <\s>

<s> it is needless to say that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the demand of either of the two parties to production labor and capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or general intelligence <\s>
<s> it is impossible then to escape the conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will under any normal investment go to the payment of wages <\s>
<s> only within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or contraction take place <\s>
<s> 3 within these limits of course minor changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be    fixed    or    absolutely predetermined    but these changes must take place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the practical side of the question <\s>
<s> how these changes act may be seen in a part of the following illustration of the above principles suppose a cotton mill established in one of the valleys of vermont for the management of which the owner has 140,000 of capital <\s>
<s> of this 100,000 is given for buildings machinery and plant <\s>
<s> if he turns over his remaining capital 40,000 each month we will suppose that 28,000 spent in raw materials will keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of 12,000 <\s>
<s> the present state of cotton manufacture itself settles the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain amount of machinery <\s>
<s> a fixed amount of cotton no more no less can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine <\s>
<s> this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is fixed for not by him <\s>
<s> now each of the five hundred laborers being supposed to receive on an average 1.00 a day imagine an influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an average for eighty cents a day 165 the five hundred men will now receive but 9,600 monthly instead of 12,000 as before as a wages fund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total capital invested 140,000 <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen that the wages fund can change with a change in the supply of labor but the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision 12,000 of the total 140,000 <\s>
<s> that is this alteration can take place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry <\s>
<s> now if this 2,400 i e 12,000 less 9,600 saved out of the wages fund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2,400 would be added to the wages fund <\s>
<s> it is worth while calling attention to this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a change can be readily made in the wages fund by natural movements and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely fixed in amount <\s>
<s> but it certainly is    predetermined    in the economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above general principles independent of the    higgling    in the labor market <\s>
<s> the following is mr <\s>
<s> cairness statement of the amount and    predetermination    of the wages fund    i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of profit will    determine    a certain proportion of this wealth to productive investment that the amount thus    determined    will increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial expectation <\s>
<s> further i believe that investment thus taking place the form which it shall assume will be    determined    by the nature of the national industriesdetermined    not under acts of parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the influence of the investors interests while this the form of the investment will again    determine    the proportion of the whole capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers    166 in this excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wages fund is not open to the objections usually urged against it <\s>
<s> indeed with the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist believes in an absolutely fixed wages fund <\s>
<s> in this sense then and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the wages fund to the number of the wage receivers 167 in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a real addition of some extent may be made to the wages fund but only by increasing the total capital <\s>
<s> if however they attempt to increase one of the elements of capital the wages fund without also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise <\s>
<s> walker 168 has also offered a solution of this problem in his    wages question    1876 in which he holds that    wages are in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of present industry and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages    p <\s>

<s> wherever the incoming product is a moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past products <\s>

<s> examination of some popular opinions respecting wages <\s>
<s> there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wages fund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain <\s>
<s> for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good <\s>
<s> the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then work people are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before <\s>
<s> this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down <\s>
<s> capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist <\s>
<s> all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state <\s>
<s> a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them <\s>
<s> but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor <\s>
<s> the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall <\s>
<s> afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment <\s>
<s> these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired <\s>
<s> again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers <\s>
<s> i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages <\s>
<s> but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor <\s>
<s> wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it <\s>
<s> nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes <\s>
<s> a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his real receipts <\s>
<s> the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real wages <\s>
<s> the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money wages <\s>
<s> since the functions of money have not yet been explained it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money wages here <\s>
<s> but as the total value of the products in a certain industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining the same with the price of the particular article <\s>
<s> if the price rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital will be invested in that one business that is the capital will be a demand for more labor and until equalization is accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages will be higher in some trades than in others 169 when reference is had to the connection between real wages and prices the question is a different one <\s>
<s> general high prices would not change general real wages <\s>
<s> but if high prices cause higher money wages in particular branches of trade then because the movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving more money the means to buy more of real wages <\s>
<s> and as in practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand are partial and not general it often happens that high prices produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in all employments <\s>
<s> for a further study of this relation between prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii chaps <\s>
<s> xx and xxi 3 <\s>
<s> another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls <\s>
<s> this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law <\s>
<s> dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity ): or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves <\s>
<s> but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap <\s>
<s> 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of foods becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so <\s>
<s> they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births <\s>
<s> in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation 170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort <\s>
<s> in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before <\s>
<s> it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a self repairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboring classes practically of no validity <\s>
<s> the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before <\s>
<s> wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised <\s>
<s> unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family <\s>
<s> according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment <\s>
<s> because laborers do not really compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he declared that there was no predetermined wages fund necessarily expended on labor and that    demand for commodities    determined the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p <\s>
<s> while the so called wages fund limits the total amount which the laborers can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages <\s>
<s> the quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity of labor to be employed <\s>
<s> about the same time but unknown to mr <\s>
<s> thornton was studying the same subject and attracted considerable attention by his publication    on labor    1868 which in book ii chap <\s>
<s> i contained an extended argument to show that demand and supply i e the proportion between wages fund and laborers did not regulate wages and denied the existence of a predetermined wages fund fixed in amount <\s>
<s> his attack however assumes a very different conception of an economic law from that which we think right to insist upon <\s>
<s> the character of mankind being what it is it will be for their interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth to be paid in wages <\s>

<s> 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the diagram is the outside limit of its capital <\s>
