<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>

<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>

<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>

<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>

<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>

<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>

<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>

<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>

<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>

<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>

<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>

<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>

<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>
<s> by relative disadvantage is meant a greater relative cost or sacrifice to the same amount of labor and capital <\s>
<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>

<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>

<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>
<s> the condition of foreign debts and the progress made in their reduction may be studied in chart no <\s>
<s> that of the united states is exceptional <\s>

<s> of an interference of government grounded on erroneous theories <\s>
<s> the doctrine of protection to native industry <\s>
<s> we proceed to the functions of government which belong to what i have termed for want of a better designation the optional class those which are sometimes assumed by governments and sometimes not and which it is not unanimously admitted that they ought to exercise <\s>
<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>

<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>

<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>

<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>

<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>

<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>

<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>

<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>

<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>

<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>

<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>

<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>

<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>

<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>

<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>

<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>

<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>

<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>

<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>

<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>

<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>

<s> the doctrine of protection to native industry <\s>
<s> we proceed to the functions of government which belong to what i have termed for want of a better designation the optional class those which are sometimes assumed by governments and sometimes not and which it is not unanimously admitted that they ought to exercise <\s>
<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>
<s> by relative disadvantage is meant a greater relative cost or sacrifice to the same amount of labor and capital <\s>
<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>
<s>    no doubt    as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes says    they would be equalized just as by compelling every one to move about with a weight attached to his leg <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>

<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>

<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>
<s> the condition of foreign debts and the progress made in their reduction may be studied in chart no <\s>

<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>

<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>

<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>

<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>

<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>

<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>

<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>

<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>

<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>

<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>

<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>

<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>

<s> of an interference of government grounded on erroneous theories <\s>
<s> the doctrine of protection to native industry <\s>
<s> we proceed to the functions of government which belong to what i have termed for want of a better designation the optional class those which are sometimes assumed by governments and sometimes not and which it is not unanimously admitted that they ought to exercise <\s>
<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>
<s> by relative disadvantage is meant a greater relative cost or sacrifice to the same amount of labor and capital <\s>
<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>
<s>    no doubt    as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes says    they would be equalized just as by compelling every one to move about with a weight attached to his leg <\s>

<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>
<s> by relative disadvantage is meant a greater relative cost or sacrifice to the same amount of labor and capital <\s>
<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>
<s>    no doubt    as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes says    they would be equalized just as by compelling every one to move about with a weight attached to his leg <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>
<s> the condition of foreign debts and the progress made in their reduction may be studied in chart no <\s>
<s> that of the united states is exceptional <\s>
<s> the interest bearing debt as given by the last report of the secretary of the treasury 1883 has been reduced to 1,312 446,050 and the reduction is more striking than is indicated in the chart for the year 1880 <\s>

<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>

<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>

<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>

<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>

<s> we proceed to the functions of government which belong to what i have termed for want of a better designation the optional class those which are sometimes assumed by governments and sometimes not and which it is not unanimously admitted that they ought to exercise <\s>
<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>

<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>

<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>

<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>

<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>

<s> we proceed to the functions of government which belong to what i have termed for want of a better designation the optional class those which are sometimes assumed by governments and sometimes not and which it is not unanimously admitted that they ought to exercise <\s>
<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>
<s> by relative disadvantage is meant a greater relative cost or sacrifice to the same amount of labor and capital <\s>
<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>
<s>    no doubt    as mr <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>

<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>
<s> the condition of foreign debts and the progress made in their reduction may be studied in chart no <\s>
<s> that of the united states is exceptional <\s>
<s> the interest bearing debt as given by the last report of the secretary of the treasury 1883 has been reduced to 1,312 446,050 and the reduction is more striking than is indicated in the chart for the year 1880 <\s>

<s> of an interference of government grounded on erroneous theories <\s>
<s> the doctrine of protection to native industry <\s>
<s> we proceed to the functions of government which belong to what i have termed for want of a better designation the optional class those which are sometimes assumed by governments and sometimes not and which it is not unanimously admitted that they ought to exercise <\s>
<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>
<s> by relative disadvantage is meant a greater relative cost or sacrifice to the same amount of labor and capital <\s>
<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>
<s> after duties are thus supposed to have protected the less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all industries will then have an equal chance <\s>
<s>    no doubt    as mr <\s>

<s> we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious <\s>
<s> of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industrya phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home <\s>
<s> if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable <\s>
<s> the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss <\s>
<s> it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public <\s>
<s> it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country <\s>
<s> to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad <\s>
<s> the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor <\s>
<s> those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people <\s>
<s> all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer <\s>
<s> of the industries in a country some are said to    need protection    and others notthat is those industries which are carried on at a relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in order that they may continue in operation <\s>

<s> those industries which can not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in them as other more profitable industries are those which are said to    need protection    wherever protective duties exist it is implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or occupations <\s>

<s>    had its origin in the mercantile system <\s>
<s> the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation <\s>
<s> the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself <\s>
<s> the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely <\s>
<s> for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade <\s>
<s> as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists <\s>
<s> the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes <\s>
<s> this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business <\s>
<s> no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession <\s>
<s> the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system <\s>
<s> whatever hold that system has over mens minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country <\s>
<s> the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners <\s>
<s> the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident <\s>
<s> without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise 358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people <\s>
<s> the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article <\s>
<s> those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencieson the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money <\s>
<s> now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products <\s>
<s> but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports <\s>
<s> i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does c  teris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay <\s>
<s> to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist <\s>
<s> but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities <\s>
<s> in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference <\s>
<s>    supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense <\s>
<s> defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of laborthe interests of national subsistence and of national defense 359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy <\s>
<s> on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport <\s>
<s> when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war <\s>
<s> the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient <\s>
<s> but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade <\s>
<s> the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade <\s>
<s> since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground that they keep up a    nursery of seamen    for the navy is practically obsolete <\s>
<s> the    seaman    employed on the modern naval ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of the sea since the days of sailing vessels have passed by so far as naval warfare is concerned <\s>
<s> steam and mechanical appliances now do what was before done by wind and sail <\s>
<s> mill thinks navigation laws were economicallythat is so far as increase of wealth is concerneddisadvantageous yet he believes that they may have been    politically expedient    it is possible for example that retaliation by the united states and other countries against england early in this century brought about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign shipping <\s>
<s> but it is quite another thing to say that such laws produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply <\s>
<s> that the english navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english shipping languished and suffered under them 360 moreover under the r  gime of steam and iron which drew out englands peculiar advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of the navigation lawsevents which have taken place since mr <\s>
<s> the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted to medival conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation was the cause of their enactment <\s>
<s> so long as wooden vessels did the carrying trade the natural advantages of the united states gave us a proud position on the ocean <\s>
<s> now however when it is a question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries in which we have advantages to building ships <\s>
<s> and until of late no distinction has been made between ship building and ship owning or ship sailing <\s>
<s> within the last year 1884 many burdens on ship sailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy ships abroad and sail them under our own flag 361 with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here <\s>
<s> that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface <\s>
<s> it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn <\s>
<s> in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protections sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue <\s>
<s> even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a    moderate fixed duty    was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield <\s>
<s> independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed <\s>
<s> to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue <\s>
<s> in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency <\s>
<s> the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection <\s>
<s> it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue <\s>
<s>    on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy <\s>
<s> the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country <\s>
<s> beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue <\s>
<s> in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt <\s>
<s> it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt <\s>
<s> the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation <\s>
<s> but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest <\s>
<s> if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself <\s>
<s> in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain <\s>
<s> in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected <\s>
<s> even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors <\s>
<s> after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt <\s>
<s> eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state <\s>
<s> the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure <\s>
<s> if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation <\s>
<s> the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xxii from an early date down to 1880 <\s>
<s> since the war the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to the surplus <\s>
<s> to the present time the treasury has been able to use its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured debt will exist to be redeemed 250,000 000 of 4  per cent bonds remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent bonds to the amount of 737,620 700 do not mature until 1907 <\s>
<s> having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to keep up the heavy taxation <\s>
<s> the difficulty is however that the unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for war purposes <\s>
<s> but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be continued adding to the cost of production in all industries without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the passingand only possibletrouble of a redistribution of capital in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will be one from less productive to more productive industries otherwise no change would be made <\s>
