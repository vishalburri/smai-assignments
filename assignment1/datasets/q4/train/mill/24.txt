<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>
<s> illustration chart showing the line of prices under a double standard <\s>
<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard from 1792 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>

<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>

<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>

<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>

<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>

<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>

<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>

<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard from 1792 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>
<s> illustration chart showing the line of prices under a double standard <\s>
<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>

<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>

<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>

<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>

<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>

<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>

<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>

<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>

<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>

<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>

<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard from 1792 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>
<s> illustration chart showing the line of prices under a double standard <\s>
<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>

<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>

<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>

<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>

<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>

<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>

<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>

<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>

<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>

<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>

<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>
<s> illustration chart showing the line of prices under a double standard <\s>
<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard from 1792 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>

<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>

<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>

<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>

<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>

<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>

<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>

<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard from 1792 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>
<s> illustration chart showing the line of prices under a double standard <\s>
<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>

<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>

<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>

<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>

<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>

<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>

<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>

<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>

<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>

<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>

<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard from 1792 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states with a double standard extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from 1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction in regard to the practical working of bimetallism <\s>
<s> while we have nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be maintained for any length of time and that    the poor money drives out the good    according to greshams statement <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>
<s> superposing these curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show the actual course of variations <\s>
<s> while the fluctuations are more frequent in d they are less extreme than in c <\s>
<s> illustration chart showing the line of prices under a double standard <\s>
<s> the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency <\s>
<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>
<s> the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>
<s> of a double standard and subsidiary coins <\s>
<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>

<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>

<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>

<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>

<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>

<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>

<s> goschen founded an argument in the    journal of the institute of bankers    london may 1883 and which attracted considerable attention <\s>
<s> on the other side see bourne    statistical journal    vol <\s>
<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> their durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence and this it is which makes the annual product very small in relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of production of the annual supply <\s>
<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
<s> it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply <\s>
<s> but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity <\s>
<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>

<s> the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money <\s>
<s> if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously <\s>
<s> not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up <\s>
<s> alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity <\s>
<s> it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity <\s>
<s> there are cases however in which the potential change of the precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that it affects the value of other things <\s>
<s> such a case was the change in the value of silver in 1876 <\s>
<s> the usual causes assigned for that serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and the decreased demand for export to india <\s>
<s> it is true that the exports of silver from england to india fell off from about 32,000 000 in 1871 1872 to about 23,000 000 in 1874 1875 but none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united states to london nor had germany put more than 30,000 000 of her silver on the market ;( 233 and yet the price of silver so fell that the depreciation amounted to 20  per cent as compared with the average price between 1867 and 1872 <\s>
<s> the change in value however took place without any corresponding change in the actual quantity in circulation <\s>
<s> the relation between prices and the quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact certainly as regards silver as mr <\s>
<s> mill would have us believe and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other than money <\s>
<s> it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production <\s>
<s> the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of self acting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of pricesat the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it <\s>

<s> objections to a double standard <\s>
<s> though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degreethe two precious metals as they are calledgold and silver <\s>
<s> some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done <\s>
<s> the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold ]; and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other <\s>
<s> if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable <\s>
<s> this however is far from being the fact <\s>
<s> gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously <\s>
<s> silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike <\s>
<s> suppose such a variation to take placethe value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportionone or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it <\s>
<s> suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings <\s>
<s> two consequences will ensue <\s>
<s> no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold <\s>
<s> he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign <\s>
<s> the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin <\s>
<s> the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value <\s>
<s> a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real valuethat is above the legal valuation <\s>
<s> the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use <\s>
<s> this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the purport that    money of less value drives out money of more value    where both are legal payments among individuals <\s>
<s> a celebrated instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695 <\s>
<s> they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation of greshams law and the disappearance of the perfect coins <\s>
<s> when the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased 234 jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law    at the time of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states and japan which partially opened up the last country to european traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan <\s>
<s> the most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very primitive manner <\s>
<s> it was passing current in the towns of japan for four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s 5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s 4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d <\s>
<s> the earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making profit <\s>
<s> by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled their money until the natives perceiving what was being done withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold    235 it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver <\s>
<s> instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two <\s>
<s> the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value <\s>
<s> if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most <\s>
<s> while liable to    more frequent fluctuations    prices do not follow the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as is shown by the following diagram 236 a represents the line of the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third commodity represented by the horizontal line <\s>

<s> it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard <\s>
<s> but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it <\s>
<s> when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce <\s>
<s> but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments <\s>
<s> in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings <\s>
<s> with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin <\s>
<s> the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments <\s>

<s> the claim that the value of gold has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and twenty five per cent <\s>
<s> the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended for use as the materials of moneytheir durability   is also the very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them from the law of cost of production and caused their value to depend practically upon the law of demand and supply <\s>

<s> this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter <\s>
<s> since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws <\s>
<s> to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law <\s>
