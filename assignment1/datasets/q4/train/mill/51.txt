<s>    in this state of prices cloth it is evident can not yet be exported from england into germany but linen can be imported from germany into england <\s>

<s>    the efflux of money from england and its influx into germany will raise money prices in the latter country and lower them in the former <\s>

<s> as long as the cloth exported does not suffice to pay for the linen imported money will continue to flow from england into germany and prices generally will continue to fall in england and rise in germany <\s>
<s>    by the fall however of cloth in england cloth will fall in germany also and the demand for it will increase <\s>
<s> by the rise of linen in germany linen must rise in england also and the demand for it will diminish <\s>
<s> as cloth fell in price and linen rose there would be some particular price of both articles at which the cloth exported and the linen imported would exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> at this point prices would remain because money would then cease to move out of england into germany <\s>
<s> what this point might be would entirely depend upon the circumstances and inclinations of the purchasers on both sides <\s>
<s> if the fall of cloth did not much increase the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen did not diminish very rapidly the demand for it in england much money must pass before the equilibrium is restored cloth would fall very much and linen would rise until england perhaps had to pay nearly as much for it as when she produced it for herself <\s>
<s> but if on the contrary the fall of cloth caused a very rapid increase of the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen in germany reduced very rapidly the demand in england from what it was under the influence of the first cheapness produced by the opening of the trade the cloth would very soon suffice to pay for the linen little money would pass between the two countries and england would derive a large portion of the benefit of the trade <\s>

<s>    in this state of prices cloth it is evident can not yet be exported from england into germany but linen can be imported from germany into england <\s>

<s>    the efflux of money from england and its influx into germany will raise money prices in the latter country and lower them in the former <\s>

<s> as long as the cloth exported does not suffice to pay for the linen imported money will continue to flow from england into germany and prices generally will continue to fall in england and rise in germany <\s>
<s>    by the fall however of cloth in england cloth will fall in germany also and the demand for it will increase <\s>
<s> by the rise of linen in germany linen must rise in england also and the demand for it will diminish <\s>
<s> as cloth fell in price and linen rose there would be some particular price of both articles at which the cloth exported and the linen imported would exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> at this point prices would remain because money would then cease to move out of england into germany <\s>
<s> what this point might be would entirely depend upon the circumstances and inclinations of the purchasers on both sides <\s>
<s> if the fall of cloth did not much increase the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen did not diminish very rapidly the demand for it in england much money must pass before the equilibrium is restored cloth would fall very much and linen would rise until england perhaps had to pay nearly as much for it as when she produced it for herself <\s>
<s> but if on the contrary the fall of cloth caused a very rapid increase of the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen in germany reduced very rapidly the demand in england from what it was under the influence of the first cheapness produced by the opening of the trade the cloth would very soon suffice to pay for the linen little money would pass between the two countries and england would derive a large portion of the benefit of the trade <\s>

<s>    in this state of prices cloth it is evident can not yet be exported from england into germany but linen can be imported from germany into england <\s>

<s>    the efflux of money from england and its influx into germany will raise money prices in the latter country and lower them in the former <\s>

<s> as long as the cloth exported does not suffice to pay for the linen imported money will continue to flow from england into germany and prices generally will continue to fall in england and rise in germany <\s>
<s>    by the fall however of cloth in england cloth will fall in germany also and the demand for it will increase <\s>
<s> by the rise of linen in germany linen must rise in england also and the demand for it will diminish <\s>
<s> as cloth fell in price and linen rose there would be some particular price of both articles at which the cloth exported and the linen imported would exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> at this point prices would remain because money would then cease to move out of england into germany <\s>
<s> what this point might be would entirely depend upon the circumstances and inclinations of the purchasers on both sides <\s>
<s> if the fall of cloth did not much increase the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen did not diminish very rapidly the demand for it in england much money must pass before the equilibrium is restored cloth would fall very much and linen would rise until england perhaps had to pay nearly as much for it as when she produced it for herself <\s>
<s> but if on the contrary the fall of cloth caused a very rapid increase of the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen in germany reduced very rapidly the demand in england from what it was under the influence of the first cheapness produced by the opening of the trade the cloth would very soon suffice to pay for the linen little money would pass between the two countries and england would derive a large portion of the benefit of the trade <\s>

<s>    in this state of prices cloth it is evident can not yet be exported from england into germany but linen can be imported from germany into england <\s>

<s>    the efflux of money from england and its influx into germany will raise money prices in the latter country and lower them in the former <\s>

<s> as long as the cloth exported does not suffice to pay for the linen imported money will continue to flow from england into germany and prices generally will continue to fall in england and rise in germany <\s>
<s>    by the fall however of cloth in england cloth will fall in germany also and the demand for it will increase <\s>
<s> by the rise of linen in germany linen must rise in england also and the demand for it will diminish <\s>
<s> as cloth fell in price and linen rose there would be some particular price of both articles at which the cloth exported and the linen imported would exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> at this point prices would remain because money would then cease to move out of england into germany <\s>
<s> what this point might be would entirely depend upon the circumstances and inclinations of the purchasers on both sides <\s>
<s> if the fall of cloth did not much increase the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen did not diminish very rapidly the demand for it in england much money must pass before the equilibrium is restored cloth would fall very much and linen would rise until england perhaps had to pay nearly as much for it as when she produced it for herself <\s>
<s> but if on the contrary the fall of cloth caused a very rapid increase of the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen in germany reduced very rapidly the demand in england from what it was under the influence of the first cheapness produced by the opening of the trade the cloth would very soon suffice to pay for the linen little money would pass between the two countries and england would derive a large portion of the benefit of the trade <\s>

<s> it is adapted to the imaginary case used for illustration throughout that essay the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and linen <\s>
<s>    we may at first make whatever supposition we will with respect to the value of money <\s>
<s> let us suppose therefore that before the opening of the trade the price of cloth is the same in both countries namely six shillings per yard <\s>
<s> as ten yards of cloth were supposed to exchange in england for fifteen yards of linen in germany for twenty we must suppose that linen is sold in england at four shillings per yard in germany at three <\s>
<s> cost of carriage and importers profit are left as before out of consideration <\s>
<s>    in this state of prices cloth it is evident can not yet be exported from england into germany but linen can be imported from germany into england <\s>
<s> it will be so and in the first instance the linen will be paid for in money <\s>
<s>    the efflux of money from england and its influx into germany will raise money prices in the latter country and lower them in the former <\s>
<s> linen will rise in germany above three shillings per yard and cloth above six shillings <\s>
<s> linen in england being imported from germany will since cost of carriage is not reckoned sink to the same price as in that country while cloth will fall below six shillings <\s>
<s> as soon as the price of cloth is lower in england than in germany it will begin to be exported and the price of cloth in germany will fall to what it is in england <\s>
<s> as long as the cloth exported does not suffice to pay for the linen imported money will continue to flow from england into germany and prices generally will continue to fall in england and rise in germany <\s>
<s>    by the fall however of cloth in england cloth will fall in germany also and the demand for it will increase <\s>
<s> by the rise of linen in germany linen must rise in england also and the demand for it will diminish <\s>
<s> as cloth fell in price and linen rose there would be some particular price of both articles at which the cloth exported and the linen imported would exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> at this point prices would remain because money would then cease to move out of england into germany <\s>
<s> what this point might be would entirely depend upon the circumstances and inclinations of the purchasers on both sides <\s>
<s> if the fall of cloth did not much increase the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen did not diminish very rapidly the demand for it in england much money must pass before the equilibrium is restored cloth would fall very much and linen would rise until england perhaps had to pay nearly as much for it as when she produced it for herself <\s>
<s> but if on the contrary the fall of cloth caused a very rapid increase of the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen in germany reduced very rapidly the demand in england from what it was under the influence of the first cheapness produced by the opening of the trade the cloth would very soon suffice to pay for the linen little money would pass between the two countries and england would derive a large portion of the benefit of the trade <\s>
<s> we have thus arrived at precisely the same conclusion in supposing the employment of money which we found to hold under the supposition of barter <\s>
<s>    in what shape the benefit accrues to the two nations from the trade is clear enough <\s>
<s> germany before the commencement of the trade paid six shillings per yard for broadcloth she now obtains it at a lower price <\s>
<s> this however is not the whole of her advantage <\s>
<s> as the money prices of all her other commodities have risen the money incomes of all her producers have increased <\s>
<s> this is no advantage to them in buying from each other because the price of what they buy has risen in the same ratio with their means of paying for it but it is an advantage to them in buying anything which has not risen and still more anything which has fallen <\s>
<s> they therefore benefit as consumers of cloth not merely to the extent to which cloth has fallen but also to the extent to which other prices have risen <\s>
<s> suppose that this is one tenth <\s>
<s> the same proportion of their money incomes as before will suffice to supply their other wants and the remainder being increased one tenth in amount will enable them to purchase one tenth more cloth than before even though cloth had not fallen but it has fallen so that they are doubly gainers <\s>
<s> they purchase the same quantity with less money and have more to expend upon their other wants <\s>
<s>    in england on the contrary general money prices have fallen <\s>
<s> linen however has fallen more than the rest having been lowered in price by importation from a country where it was cheaper whereas the others have fallen only from the consequent efflux of money <\s>
<s> notwithstanding therefore the general fall of money prices the english producers will be exactly as they were in all other respects while they will gain as purchasers of linen <\s>
<s>    the greater the efflux of money required to restore the equilibrium the greater will be the gain of germany both by the fall of cloth and by the rise of her general prices <\s>
<s> the less the efflux of money requisite the greater will be the gain of england because the price of linen will continue lower and her general prices will not be reduced so much <\s>
<s> it must not however be imagined that high money prices are a good and low money prices an evil in themselves <\s>
<s> but the higher the general money prices in any country the greater will be that countrys means of purchasing those commodities which being imported from abroad are independent of the causes which keep prices high at home       in practice the cloth and the linen would not as here supposed be at the same price in england and in germany each would be dearer in money price in the country which imported than in that which produced it by the amount of the cost of carriage together with the ordinary profit on the importers capital for the average length of time which elapsed before the commodity could be disposed of <\s>
<s> but it does not follow that each country pays the cost of carriage of the commodity it imports for the addition of this item to the price may operate as a greater check to demand on one side than on the other and the equation of international demand and consequent equilibrium of payments may not be maintained <\s>
<s> money would then flow out of one country into the other until in the manner already illustrated the equilibrium was restored and when this was effected one country would be paying more than its own cost of carriage and the other less       mill <\s>
