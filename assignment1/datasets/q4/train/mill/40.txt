<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>

<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>

<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>

<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>

<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>

<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>

<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>

<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>

<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>

<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>

<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>

<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>

<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>

<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>

<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>

<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>

<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>

<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>

<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>

<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>

<s> the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation <\s>

<s>    on wages <\s>
<s> we now turn to taxes on wages <\s>
<s> the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly <\s>
<s> i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment <\s>
<s> any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class <\s>

<s> the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land <\s>
<s> some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor <\s>
<s> without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum <\s>
<s> if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborersa proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see <\s>
<s> in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply <\s>
<s> where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition <\s>
<s> on whom in this case will the tax fall <\s>
<s> a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits <\s>
<s> to attempt to tax day laborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class <\s>
<s> we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence <\s>
<s> these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring class or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever <\s>

<s> thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that life incomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes <\s>
<s> an income tax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors <\s>
<s> notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors <\s>

<s> but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax collector <\s>
<s> the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself <\s>
<s> the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious <\s>
<s> it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax can not be made to attach to it in practice <\s>
<s> this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailedthat direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections <\s>
<s> the difficulties of a fair income tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each persons expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves <\s>
<s> the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues <\s>
<s> the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price <\s>
<s> the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature <\s>
<s> they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are leviedthose who use the commodity taxed <\s>
<s> a tax of a similar description and more important is a house tax which must be considered at somewhat greater length <\s>
<s> the rent of a house consists of two parts the ground rent and what adam smith calls the building rent <\s>
<s> the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares <\s>
<s> the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building <\s>
<s> the fact of its being received in quarterly or half yearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated <\s>
<s> it comprises the ordinary profit on the builders capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a building lease <\s>
<s> a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike <\s>
<s> the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause <\s>
<s> the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately <\s>
<s> as much of it as is a tax on building rent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier <\s>
<s> for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built <\s>
<s> it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house <\s>
<s> a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation <\s>
<s> houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand <\s>
<s> the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount <\s>
<s> new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together <\s>
<s> by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier <\s>
<s> in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on <\s>
<s> the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on ground rent <\s>
<s> as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on ground rent one would suppose must fall on the ground landlord at least after the expiration of the building lease <\s>
<s> it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on ground rent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent <\s>
<s> the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation <\s>
<s> if therefore a tax were laid on ground rents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest ground rents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on building rents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax <\s>
<s> but whatever raises the lowest ground rents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages <\s>
<s> if therefore the tax on ground rents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier <\s>
<s> suppose the lowest ground rent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5,000 a tax of 5 per acre on ground rents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5,005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier <\s>
<s> but a tax on ground rent is supposed to be a portion of a house tax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent <\s>
<s> the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5,005 <\s>
<s> consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the ground landlord 341 a house tax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on ground rents <\s>
<s> in the vast majority of houses the ground rent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier <\s>
<s> it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the ground rent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these ground rents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk <\s>
<s> so far therefore as a house tax falls on the ground landlord it is liable to no valid objection <\s>
<s> in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes <\s>
<s> no part of a persons expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them <\s>
<s> the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds <\s>
<s> the first is that a miser may escape it <\s>
<s> this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser <\s>
<s> the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family <\s>
<s> of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a persons own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted 342 a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements <\s>
<s> the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax <\s>

<s> by taxes on commodities are commonly meant those which are levied either on the producers or on the carriers or dealers who intervene between them and the final purchasers for consumption the phrase being by custom confined to indirect taxesthose which are advanced by one person to be as is expected and intended reimbursed by another <\s>
<s> taxes on commodities are either on production within the country or on importation into it or on conveyance or sale within it and are classed respectively as excise customs or tolls and transit duties <\s>
<s> to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market <\s>
<s> when the cost of production is increased artificially by a tax the effect is the same as when it is increased by natural causes <\s>
<s> if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different <\s>
<s> there would however as mr <\s>
<s> mcculloch has pointed out be a disturbance of values some falling others rising owing to a circumstance the effect of which on values and prices we formerly discussedthe different durability of the capital employed in different occupations <\s>
<s> the gross produce of industry consists of two parts one portion serving to replace the capital consumed while the other portion is profit <\s>
<s> now equal capital in two branches of production must have equal expectations of profit but if a greater portion of the one than of the other is fixed capital or if that fixed capital is more durable there will be a less consumption of capital in the year and less will be required to replace it so that the profit if absolutely the same will form a greater proportion of the annual returns <\s>
<s> to derive from a capital of 1,000 a profit of 100 the one producer may have to sell produce to the value of 1,100 the other only to the value of 500 <\s>
<s> if on these two branches of industry a tax be imposed of five per cent ad valorem the last will be charged only with 25 the first with 55 leaving to the one 75 profit to the other only 45 <\s>
<s> to equalize therefore their expectation of profit the one commodity must rise in price or the other must fall or both 343 commodities made chiefly by immediate labor must rise in value as compared with those which are chiefly made by machinery <\s>
<s> it is unnecessary to prosecute this branch of the inquiry any further <\s>
