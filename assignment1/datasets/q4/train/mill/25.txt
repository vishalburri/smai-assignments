<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>

<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>

<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>

<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>

<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>

<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> if the borrowers means of production and of employing labor are increased by the credit given him the lenders are as much diminished <\s>
<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>

<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>

<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>

<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>

<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>

<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>

<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>

<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>

<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>

<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>

<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>

<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>

<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>

<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>

<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>

<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>

<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>

<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> if the borrowers means of production and of employing labor are increased by the credit given him the lenders are as much diminished <\s>
<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>

<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>

<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>

<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412  grains being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not depreciate to that value <\s>
<s> the government buys the silver owns the coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the treasury <\s>
<s> and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit and silver certificates received in return <\s>
<s> there being no free coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the demand for change instead of small bills the dollar pieces will circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary coin even though overvalued <\s>
<s> and the silver certificates practically go through a process of constant redemption by being received for customs dues equally with gold <\s>
<s> when they become too great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look for the depreciation with good reason 240 there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance ); 2 the silver dollar of 412  grains 3 united states notes except for customs and interest on the public debt ); 4 subsidiary silver coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to the amount of twenty five cents <\s>

<s> the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international agreement <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>

<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>

<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
<s> this system a single gold standard for large and silver for small payments continued without question and with great convenience until the days of the war when paper money 1862 1879 drove out by its cheapness again both gold and silver <\s>
<s> paper was far cheaper than the cheapest of the two metals <\s>
<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>
<s> the mere fact that the silver dollar piece had not circulated since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 15.98 the obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 <\s>
<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>
<s> it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371  grains of pure silver <\s>
<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>
<s> in 1873 moreover the mint was permitted to put its stamp and devicesto what was not money at all but a    coined ingoton 378 grains of pure silver 420 grains standard known as the    trade dollar    it was intended by this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the asiatic trade <\s>
<s> oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver in payments <\s>
<s> the mexican silver dollar contained 377  grains of pure silver the japanese yen 374 4 10 and the united states dollar 371  <\s>
<s> by making the    trade dollar    slightly heavier than any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new market and the united states government was simply asked to certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage <\s>
<s> inadvertently the trade dollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873 which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 <\s>
<s> so that the trade dollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it contained more silver than the 412  grains dollar <\s>
<s> they ceased to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made 35,959 360 <\s>
<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>
<s> in february 1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was practically reached in the august following <\s>
<s> unless a repeal of the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of trade arising from a change of the standard <\s>

<s> illustration relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876 <\s>

<s> this is what is known as the    demonetization    of silver <\s>
<s> it had no effect on the circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not been for more than twenty five years <\s>
<s> there had been no desire up to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage arose <\s>
<s> when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86 cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks <\s>
<s> thus while from 1853 and even before we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only one standard that of gold <\s>

<s> of course alloy is mixed with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all its    standard    weight <\s>
<s> in 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight which as the 371  grains of pure silver were unchanged gave the total weight of the dollar as 412  grains whence the familiar name assigned to this piece <\s>

<s> in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver dollar piece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 15.98 while the market ratio was 1 to 17.87 <\s>
<s> so extraordinary a reversal of all sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of silver mines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness <\s>
<s> there was no pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the disappearance of gold entirely <\s>
<s> this would happen if owners could bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage    free coinage    and so exchange silver against gold coin for the purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as coin than as bullion <\s>
<s> this immediate result was prevented by a provision in the law which prevented the    free coinage    of silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin at least 2,000 000 in silver each month <\s>
<s> this retarded but will not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a single silver standard <\s>
<s> at the rate of 24,000 000 a year it is only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation <\s>

<s> with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1 that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar <\s>
<s> so while the various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states seemed to contain on the average about 371  grains of pure silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 1/15 of 371  grains or 24  grains of pure gold into the gold dollar <\s>
<s> it was the best possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio <\s>
<s> if this conformity could have been maintained there would have been no disturbance <\s>
<s> but a cause was already in operation affecting the supply of one of the metalssilverwholly independent of legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold <\s>
<s> two periods of production of silver in which the production of silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the history of that metal <\s>
<s> 1 one was the enormous yield from the mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and 2 the only other period of great production at all comparable with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness of the mexican silver mines <\s>
<s> the first period of ninety five years was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while about forty seven times as much silver as gold was produced on an average during the first period the average annual amount of silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater from 1780 to 1820 <\s>
<s> the effect of the first period in lowering the relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of silver relatively to gold ); that the effect of the second period on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually causedit has not been smallis explicable only by the laws of the value of money <\s>
<s> if you let the same amount of water into a small reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former will be raised more than the level of the latter <\s>
<s> the great production of the first period was added to a very small existing stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock increased by the great previous production just mentioned <\s>
<s> the smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity existing in the world requires some time even for a production of silver forty seven times greater than the gold production to take its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence <\s>
<s> the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the united states decided on a double standard <\s>
<s> for this reason the value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver continued to decline even after that time because the increased production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself felt <\s>
<s> thus we have the phenomenonwhich seems very difficult for some persons to understandof a falling off in the annual production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value relatively to gold <\s>
<s> this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance of gold was everywhere commented upon <\s>
<s> the process by which this result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the mint and market ratios <\s>
<s> in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver was 1 to 15.7    that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24  grains would exchange for 15.7 times as many grains of silver in the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of silver <\s>
<s> a broker having 1,000 gold dollars could buy with them in the market silver bullion enough 1,000   15.7 grains to have coined when presented at the mint 1,000 dollars in silver pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700 grains of silver <\s>
<s> so long as this can be done silver the cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good <\s>
<s> the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value of silver <\s>
<s> it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819 237 chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver began too early to have been due to english measures even if conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should naturally have fallen in value <\s>
<s> chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold and silver from 1501 to 1880 <\s>
<s> from 1501 to 1680 a space is allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years from 1876 to 1880 to each year <\s>
<s> the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 <\s>
<s> two courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold dollar piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the depreciation of silver since 1792 <\s>
<s> the latter expedient without any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of our monetary standard was adopted 6.589 per cent was taken out of the gold dollar leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371  grains the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988 or as commonly stated 1 to 16 <\s>
<s> did this correspond with the market ratio then existing <\s>
<s> having seen the former steady fall in silver and believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little larger than the market ratio <\s>
<s> this was done by establishing the mint ratio of 1 to 15.988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to 15.73 <\s>
<s> here again appeared the difficulty arising from the attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the coinageforces of a similar kind but working in exactly the opposite direction to those previous to 1834 <\s>
<s> a dollar of gold coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint 15.98 than it would in the form of bullion in the market 15.73 <\s>
<s> therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into coin than exchange it as bullion <\s>
<s> gold was sent to the mint while silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being more valuable as bullion than as coin <\s>
<s> by 1840 a silver dollar was worth 102 cents in gold 238 this movement which was displacing silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by lowering the value of gold <\s>
<s> here again was another natural cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly the opposite direction from that in the previous period when silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines <\s>
<s> in 1853 a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold i e of a gold dollar containing 23.22 grains ); but some years before all silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in circulation <\s>
<s> for a large part of this period we had in reality a single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in the currency <\s>
<s> after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the legislation of 1853 <\s>
<s> this act made no further changes intended to adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with the gold circulation <\s>
<s> but hitherto no regard had been paid to the principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill in the last section   2 <\s>
<s> the act of 1853 while acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver dollar pieces had all gone out of circulation <\s>
<s> before this two halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of pure silver as the dollar piece 371  grains ); therefore when it became profitable to withdraw the dollar pieces and substitute gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or four quarters in silver <\s>
<s> for this reason all the subsidiary silver had gone out of circulation and there was no    small change    in the country <\s>
<s> the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollars worth of subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains <\s>
<s> by making so much less an amount of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed considerably in their relative values 345.6 grains of silver could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a gold dollar when 371  grains were worth only 104 cents of the gold dollar ); 2 this over valuation of silver in subsidiary coin would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes other than for effecting change its legal tender power was restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars <\s>
