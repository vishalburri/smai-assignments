<s> the value of money is to appearance an expression as precise as free from possibility of misunderstanding as any in science <\s>
<s> the value of a thing is what it will exchange for the value of money is what money will exchange for the purchasing power of money <\s>
<s> if prices are low money will buy much of other things and is of high value if prices are high it will buy little of other things and is of low value <\s>
<s> the value of money is inversely as general prices falling as they rise and rising as they fall <\s>
<s> when one person lends to another as well as when he pays wages or rent to another what he transfers is not the mere money but a right to a certain value of the produce of the country to be selected at pleasure the lender having first bought this right by giving for it a portion of his capital <\s>
<s> what he really lends is so much capital the money is the mere instrument of transfer <\s>
<s> but the capital usually passes from the lender to the receiver through the means either of money or of an order to receive money and at any rate it is in money that the capital is computed and estimated <\s>
<s> hence borrowing capital is universally called borrowing money the loan market is called the money market those who have their capital disposable for investment on loan are called the moneyed class and the equivalent given for the use of capital or in other words interest is not only called the interest of money but by a grosser perversion of terms the value of money <\s>
<s> the value of money depends on its quantity <\s>
<s> the value or purchasing power of money depends in the first instance on demand and supply <\s>
<s> but demand and supply in relation to money present themselves in a somewhat different shape from the demand and supply of other things <\s>
<s> the supply of a commodity means the quantity offered for sale <\s>
<s> but it is not usual to speak of offering money for sale <\s>
<s> people are not usually said to buy or sell money <\s>
<s> this however is merely an accident of language <\s>
<s> in point of fact money is bought and sold like other things whenever other things are bought and sold for money <\s>
<s> whoever sells corn or tallow or cotton buys money <\s>
<s> whoever buys bread or wine or clothes sells money to the dealer in those articles <\s>
<s> the money with which people are offering to buy is money offered for sale <\s>
<s> the supply of money then is the quantity of it which people are wanting to lay out that is all the money they have in their possession except what they are hoarding or at least keeping by them as a reserve for future contingencies <\s>
<s> the supply of money in short is all the money in circulation at the time <\s>
<s> the demand for money again consists of all the goods offered for sale <\s>
<s> every seller of goods is a buyer of money and the goods he brings with him constitute his demand <\s>
<s> the demand for money differs from the demand for other things in this that it is limited only by the means of the purchaser <\s>
<s> in this last statement mr <\s>
<s> mill is misled by his former definition of demand as    quantity demanded    he has the true idea of demand in this case regarding money but the demand for money does not as he thinks differ from the demand for other things inasmuch as in our corrected view of demand for other things p <\s>
<s> 255 it was found that the demand for other things than money was also limited by the means of the purchaser 228 as the whole of the goods in the market compose the demand for money so the whole of the money constitutes the demand for goods <\s>
<s> the money and the goods are seeking each other for the purpose of being exchanged <\s>
<s> they are reciprocally supply and demand to one another <\s>
<s> it is indifferent whether in characterizing the phenomena we speak of the demand and supply of goods or the supply and the demand of money <\s>
<s> they are equivalent expressions <\s>
<s> supposing the money in the hands of individuals to be increased the wants and inclinations of the community collectively in respect to consumption remaining exactly the same the increase of demand would reach all things equally and there would be a universal rise of prices <\s>
<s> let us rather suppose therefore that to every pound or shilling or penny in the possession of any one another pound shilling or penny were suddenly added <\s>
<s> there would be an increased money demand and consequently an increased money value or price for things of all sorts <\s>
<s> this increased value would do no good to any one would make no difference except that of having to reckon dollars and cents in higher numbers <\s>
<s> it would be an increase of values only as estimated in money a thing only wanted to buy other things with and would not enable any one to buy more of them than before <\s>
<s> prices would have risen in a certain ratio and the value of money would have fallen in the same ratio <\s>
<s> it is to be remarked that this ratio would be precisely that in which the quantity of money had been increased <\s>
<s> if the whole money in circulation was doubled prices would be doubled <\s>
<s> if it was only increased one fourth prices would rise one fourth <\s>
<s> there would be one fourth more money all of which would be used to purchase goods of some description <\s>
<s> when there had been time for the increased supply of money to reach all markets or according to the conventional metaphor to permeate all the channels of circulation all prices would have risen one fourth <\s>
<s> but the general rise of price is independent of this diffusing and equalizing process <\s>
<s> even if some prices were raised more and others less the average rise would be one fourth <\s>
<s> this is a necessary consequence of the fact that a fourth more money would have been given for only the same quantity of goods <\s>
<s> general prices therefore would in any case be a fourth higher <\s>
<s> so that the value of money other things being the same varies inversely as its quantity every increase of quantity lowering the value and every diminution raising it in a ratio exactly equivalent <\s>
<s> this it must be observed is a property peculiar to money <\s>
<s> we did not find it to be true of commodities generally that every diminution of supply raised the value exactly in proportion to the deficiency or that every increase lowered it in the precise ratio of the excess <\s>
<s> some things are usually affected in a greater ratio than that of the excess or deficiency others usually in a less because in ordinary cases of demand the desire being for the thing itself may be stronger or weaker and the amount of what people are willing to expend on it being in any case a limited quantity may be affected in very unequal degrees by difficulty or facility of attainment <\s>
<s> but in the case of money which is desired as the means of universal purchase the demand consists of everything which people have to sell and the only limit to what they are willing to give is the limit set by their having nothing more to offer <\s>
