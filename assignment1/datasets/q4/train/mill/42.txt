<s> until the last few years we have had a reciprocity treaty with canada but it is not now in force and an arrangement for closer commercial relations with mexico is now under consideration <\s>
<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>

<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>

<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>

<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>

<s> the annual interest charge is lessening with the payment of the public debt having fallen from its highest figure of 143,781 591 in 1867 to 59,160 131 in 1883 349 our national taxation is practically all indirect that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost all articles which can be imported materials as well as manufactures <\s>
<s> in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property is very generally levied for state county and municipal purposes <\s>
<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>
<s> people do not seem to be aware of the enormous national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> other countries it will be seen make a greater use of direct taxation than the united states <\s>
<s> in fact the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their experience <\s>
<s> the english system is especially interesting because after having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is true generally on those which could not be produced in england but by the income tax and other forms 350 in 1842 sir robert peel found 1,200 articles subject to customs duties <\s>
<s> he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent <\s>
<s> now customs duties are levied only on beer cards chiccory chocolate cocoa coffee dried fruit plate spirits tea tobacco and wine <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>
<s> production amount of tax <\s>
<s> indicated by the tax gallons <\s>
<s> 1862 1863 3,200 000 16,000 000 july 1862 20 c <\s>
<s> 1867 1868 14,200 000 7,000 000 jan 1865 2 per gallon <\s>
<s> 1868 1869 34,200 000 16,000 000 july 1868 50 c <\s>
<s> 1869 1870 39,200 000 18,000 000 the actual amount reached by taxation is very much less than that known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of gallons or nearly one half the product <\s>
<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>
<s> thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported <\s>

<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
<s> the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious co operation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality <\s>
<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>

<s> in the case of an income tax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected income tax to    realized property    in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder <\s>
<s> but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient <\s>
<s> we have seen however that a house tax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an income tax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes <\s>
<s> but it would be impossible to raise by a house tax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation <\s>
<s> a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent <\s>
<s> besides 1 the land tax 346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes <\s>
<s> 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue <\s>
<s> with these taxes and 5 a house tax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation <\s>
<s> the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable <\s>
<s> what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible <\s>
<s> there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded <\s>
<s> 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported <\s>
<s> 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries <\s>
<s> such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth 347 what remain are taxes on luxuries <\s>
<s> and these have some properties which strongly recommend them <\s>
<s> in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences <\s>
<s> in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law <\s>
<s> a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation <\s>
<s> when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation <\s>
<s> practical rules for indirect taxation <\s>
<s> in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 <\s>
<s> to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament <\s>
<s> but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one riding horse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness <\s>
<s> whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax <\s>
<s> but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes <\s>
<s> this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich <\s>
<s> tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden <\s>
<s> something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike <\s>
<s> as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with <\s>
<s> among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things <\s>
<s> as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop <\s>
<s> custom duties are c  teris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount <\s>
<s> no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characterssmugglers illicit distillers and the like <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in this direction <\s>
<s> during the war we imposed an internal revenue tax on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices to escape the payment <\s>
<s> the following table will show how the production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was excessive <\s>
<s> it forced evasions by distillers <\s>
<s> it has been found by various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely increased <\s>

<s> the openness of the frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were    openly sold in the market and even quoted in price currents at from five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the average cost of manufacture    348 in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge <\s>
<s> the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production <\s>
<s> in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers <\s>

<s> in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town expenditures <\s>

<s> comparison between direct and indirect taxation <\s>
<s> arguments for and against direct taxation <\s>
<s> are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible <\s>
<s> a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying <\s>
<s> he dislikes seeing the face of the tax collector and being subjected to his peremptory demand <\s>
<s> perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all <\s>
<s> that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so <\s>
<s> the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing <\s>
<s> they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable <\s>
<s> under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him <\s>
<s> if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure <\s>
<s> although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing <\s>
<s> the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized <\s>
<s> the mere distinction between paying money directly to the tax collector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the tea dealer or the wine merchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence <\s>
<s> if our present revenue of 400,000 000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while mens minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good <\s>
<s> of the 400,000 000 in question nearly 60,000 000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith <\s>
<s> that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206,000 000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment <\s>
<s> if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public <\s>
<s> there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy <\s>
<s> we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity <\s>
<s> he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation <\s>
<s> suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year <\s>
<s> he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden <\s>
<s> true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an income tax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory <\s>
<s> if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him <\s>
<s> on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him <\s>
<s> it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount <\s>
<s> he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax <\s>
<s> the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser <\s>
