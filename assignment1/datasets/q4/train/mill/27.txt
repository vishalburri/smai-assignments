<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>

<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>

<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>

<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>

<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>

<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>

<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>

<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>

<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>

<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>

<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>

<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>

<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>

<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>

<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>

<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>

<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>

<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>

<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>

<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>

<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>

<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>

<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>

<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>

<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>

<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>

<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>

<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>

<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>

<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>

<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>

<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>

<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>

<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>

<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>

<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>

<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>

<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>

<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>

<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>

<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>

<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>

<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>

<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>

<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>

<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>

<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>

<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>

<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>

<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>

<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>

<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>

<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>

<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>

<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>

<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>

<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>

<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>

<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>

<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>

<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>

<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>

<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>

<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>

<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>

<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>

<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>

<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>

<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>

<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>

<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>

<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>

<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>

<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>
<s> there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> the temptation to over issue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it <\s>
<s> the french government in the franco prussian war 1870 issued inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill but acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one half of one per cent <\s>
<s> but this was a very rare management of inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the price of gold in paper rose above par <\s>
<s> examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property <\s>
<s> projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is in truth a great charm in the idea <\s>
<s> to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it <\s>
<s> the philosophers stone could not be expected to do more 248 as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves <\s>
<s> one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on <\s>
<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>
<s> i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up <\s>
<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>

<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>

<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>

<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>

<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
<s> there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes <\s>
<s> all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents <\s>
<s> it is not so however with an inconvertible currency <\s>
<s> to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check <\s>
<s> the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit <\s>
<s> such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil <\s>
<s> all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious <\s>
<s> the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence <\s>
<s> great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profitnot to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed <\s>
<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>
<s> the disaster that might be brought upon the country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon <\s>
<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>

<s> the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by the second legal tender decision that the issue of greenbacks inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was unconstitutional <\s>
<s> this view however was met by the unfortunate decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march 1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue of legal tender paper money was to be determined solely by congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section 8) which gave congress the means to do whatever was    necessary and proper    to carry out the powers expressly granted to it <\s>
<s> nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of absolutely no value <\s>

<s> if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient <\s>
<s> in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs <\s>
<s> nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins <\s>
<s> this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> there is not indeed the self acting check which convertibility brings with it <\s>
<s> but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent <\s>
<s> that indication is the price of the precious metals <\s>
<s> when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint priceif an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 18.60 is sold for 20 or 25 in paperthe value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be <\s>
<s> if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper <\s>
<s> but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption <\s>
<s> an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency <\s>
<s> the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from 130,000 000 to 140,000 000 is a sufficient reserve for outstanding notes to the amount of 346,000 000 and greenbacks are now at a par with gold <\s>
<s> against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force <\s>
<s> but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity <\s>
<s> everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars <\s>
<s> regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations <\s>
<s> there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to <\s>
<s> the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule <\s>

<s> these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or well defined idea when they do their meaning is no more than thisthat the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value <\s>

<s> on this theory there have been many schemes for    coining the whole land of the country into money    and the like <\s>
<s> of an inconvertible paper currency <\s>
<s> what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money <\s>
<s> after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified <\s>
<s> they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes <\s>
<s> in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others <\s>
<s> the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production <\s>
<s> we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity <\s>
<s> if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production <\s>
<s> the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary <\s>
<s> the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly dependent on the quantity issued <\s>
<s> the general level of value depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from this general level in the direction of further depreciation than could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing value for his paper <\s>
<s> the    convention    by which real value the essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the minds of all is thereby broken <\s>
<s> fiat moneythat is a piece of paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple declaration that this is a dollartherefore separates the paper from any connection with value <\s>
<s> and yet we see that fiat money has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the debts <\s>
<s> jevons remarks on this point 247 that if    the quantity of notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for notes    stability of value might be secured <\s>
<s> if there is more in circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin to affect the value <\s>
<s> although the paper is not even a promise to pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as its designation generally tends under the force of convention and habit to give a popular value to paper <\s>
<s> although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in coin to some amount <\s>
<s> in the early cases of irredeemable money in our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were promised as a means of redemption <\s>
<s> to somealthough a slightextent the idea of value was associated with such paper <\s>
<s> the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation <\s>
<s> the paper did depreciate with increased issues <\s>
<s> but only in so far as the increased issues proved to the community that there was less and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they depreciate <\s>
<s> in other words we come to the familiar experience known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the opinions of men in the country <\s>
<s> this was partially true even of our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement of the line in chart xii p <\s>
<s> 359 which represents the fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war <\s>
<s> the upward movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during our late war of course represents correspondingly the depreciation of the paper <\s>
<s> every victory or defeat of the union arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with the paper <\s>
<s> the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this which produced the effect on their value <\s>
<s> it was not only the quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity <\s>
<s> it is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the issues increased <\s>
<s> but the thing which weighed largely in peoples minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium on gold was practically a register of the    betting    on this possibility <\s>
<s> in 1878 when secretary shermans reserve was seen to be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident that he would have the means i e the value represented by all the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away <\s>
<s> the general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that consequent on the resumption act in may 1878 <\s>
<s> suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities <\s>
<s> the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver <\s>
<s> an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper <\s>
<s> then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before <\s>
<s> suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no <\s>
<s> xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 ]: that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments <\s>
<s> the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value <\s>
<s> we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method <\s>
<s> mills statement that if paper be not issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin    as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments    will not hold true <\s>
<s> during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a fractional paper currency <\s>
<s> by an amendment inserted june 17 1862 into the act authorizing a second issue of 150,000 000 of greenbacks it was ordered    that no note shall be issued for the fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35,000 000 shall be of lower denominations than five dollars    act finally passed july 11 1862 <\s>
<s> although there were no fractional notes yet one dollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 345.6 grains of silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar <\s>
<s> by july 2d the disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted <\s>
<s> let the value of gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin 345.6 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 <\s>
<s> now if paper depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with greshams law <\s>
<s> up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not <\s>
<s> it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative <\s>
<s> when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded <\s>
<s> the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion <\s>
