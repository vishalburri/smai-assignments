<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>

<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>

<s> when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase <\s>

<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>

<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>
<s> the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak <\s>

<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>

<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>

<s> when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase <\s>

<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>
<s> in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil <\s>
<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>
<s> the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak <\s>
<s> in australia and the united states of america the effective desire of accumulation is strong capital increases fast and the production of food might be very rapidly extended <\s>

<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>

<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>

<s> it should be said moreover that socialism is to day used in the distinct sense of a system which abolishes private property and places the control of the capital labor and combined industries of the country in the hands of the state <\s>

<s> collectivism is also a term now used by german and french writers to describe an organization of the industries of a country under a collective instead of an individual management <\s>
<s> collectivism is but the french expression for the system of state socialism <\s>

<s> the objection ordinarily made to a system of community of property and equal distribution of the produce that each person would be incessantly occupied in evading his fair share of the work points undoubtedly to a real difficulty <\s>
<s> but those who urge this objection forget to how great an extent the same difficulty exists under the system on which nine tenths of the business of society is now conducted <\s>
<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>
<s> but though improvement may during a certain space of time keep up with or even surpass the actual increase of population it assuredly never comes up to the rate of increase of which population is capable and nothing could have prevented a general deterioration in the condition of the human race were it not that population has in fact been restrained <\s>

<s> though the gross produce would not have been so great there would have been a greater produce per head of the population <\s>
<s> necessity of restraining population not superseded by free trade in food <\s>
<s> when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase <\s>
<s> one of these expedients is the importation of food from abroad <\s>
<s> the other is emigration <\s>
<s> the admission of cheaper food from a foreign country is equivalent to an agricultural invention by which food could be raised at a similarly diminished cost at home <\s>
<s> it equally increases the productive power of labor <\s>
<s> the return was before so much food for so much labor employed in the growth of food the return is now a greater quantity of food for the same labor employed in producing cottons or hardware or some other commodity to be given in exchange for food <\s>
<s> the one improvement like the other throws back the decline of the productive power of labor by a certain distance but in the one case as in the other it immediately resumes its course the tide which has receded instantly begins to readvance <\s>
<s> it might seem indeed that when a country draws its supply of food from so wide a surface as the whole habitable globe so little impression can be produced on that great expanse by any increase of mouths in one small corner of it that the inhabitants of the country may double and treble their numbers without feeling the effect in any increased tension of the springs of production or any enhancement of the price of food throughout the world <\s>
<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>
<s> in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil <\s>
<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>
<s> the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak <\s>
<s> in australia and the united states of america the effective desire of accumulation is strong capital increases fast and the production of food might be very rapidly extended <\s>
<s> but in such countries population also increases with extraordinary rapidity <\s>
<s> their agriculture has to provide for their own expanding numbers as well as for those of the importing countries <\s>
<s> they must therefore from the nature of the case be rapidly driven if not to less fertile at least what is equivalent to remoter and less accessible lands and to modes of cultivation like those of old countries less productive in proportion to the labor and expense <\s>

<s> xviii see book iv chap <\s>
<s> iii may give some idea of the agricultural possibilities of our land <\s>
<s> it will be seen from this that the quantity of fertile land in but one of our statestexasis greater than that of austria hungary <\s>
<s> but the countries which have at the same time cheap food and great industrial prosperity are few being only those in which the arts of civilized life have been transferred full grown to a rich and uncultivated soil <\s>
<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>
<s> such countries are russia poland and hungary <\s>
<s> the law therefore of diminishing return to industry whenever population makes a more rapid progress than improvement is not solely applicable to countries which are fed from their own soil but in substance applies quite as much to those which are willing to draw their food from any accessible quarter that can afford it cheapest <\s>
<s>    nor by emigration <\s>
<s> besides the importation of corn there is another resource which can be invoked by a nation whose increasing numbers press hard not against their capital but against the productive capacity of their land i mean emigration especially in the form of colonization <\s>
<s> of this remedy the efficacy as far as it goes is real since it consists in seeking elsewhere those unoccupied tracts of fertile land which if they existed at home would enable the demand of an increasing population to be met without any falling off in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> accordingly when the region to be colonized is near at hand and the habits and tastes of the people sufficiently migratory this remedy is completely effectual <\s>
<s> the migration from the older parts of the american confederation to the new territories which is to all intents and purposes colonization is what enables population to go on unchecked throughout the union without having yet diminished the return to industry or increased the difficulty of earning a subsistence <\s>

<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>
<s> in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil <\s>
<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>

<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>

<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>

<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>

<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>

<s> when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase <\s>

<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>
<s> in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil <\s>
<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>
<s> the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak <\s>
<s> in australia and the united states of america the effective desire of accumulation is strong capital increases fast and the production of food might be very rapidly extended <\s>

<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>
<s> the word socialism which originated among the english communists and was assumed by them as a name to designate their own doctrine is now on the continent employed in a larger sense not necessarily implying communism or the entire abolition of private property but applied to any system which requires that the land and the instruments of production should be the property not of individuals but of communities or associations or of the government <\s>
<s> it should be said moreover that socialism is to day used in the distinct sense of a system which abolishes private property and places the control of the capital labor and combined industries of the country in the hands of the state <\s>

<s> collectivism is also a term now used by german and french writers to describe an organization of the industries of a country under a collective instead of an individual management <\s>

<s> the objection ordinarily made to a system of community of property and equal distribution of the produce that each person would be incessantly occupied in evading his fair share of the work points undoubtedly to a real difficulty <\s>
<s> but those who urge this objection forget to how great an extent the same difficulty exists under the system on which nine tenths of the business of society is now conducted <\s>
<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>
<s> but though improvement may during a certain space of time keep up with or even surpass the actual increase of population it assuredly never comes up to the rate of increase of which population is capable and nothing could have prevented a general deterioration in the condition of the human race were it not that population has in fact been restrained <\s>

<s> though the gross produce would not have been so great there would have been a greater produce per head of the population <\s>
<s> necessity of restraining population not superseded by free trade in food <\s>
<s> when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase <\s>
<s> one of these expedients is the importation of food from abroad <\s>
<s> the other is emigration <\s>
<s> the admission of cheaper food from a foreign country is equivalent to an agricultural invention by which food could be raised at a similarly diminished cost at home <\s>
<s> it equally increases the productive power of labor <\s>
<s> the return was before so much food for so much labor employed in the growth of food the return is now a greater quantity of food for the same labor employed in producing cottons or hardware or some other commodity to be given in exchange for food <\s>
<s> the one improvement like the other throws back the decline of the productive power of labor by a certain distance but in the one case as in the other it immediately resumes its course the tide which has receded instantly begins to readvance <\s>
<s> it might seem indeed that when a country draws its supply of food from so wide a surface as the whole habitable globe so little impression can be produced on that great expanse by any increase of mouths in one small corner of it that the inhabitants of the country may double and treble their numbers without feeling the effect in any increased tension of the springs of production or any enhancement of the price of food throughout the world <\s>
<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>
<s> in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil <\s>
<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>
<s> the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak <\s>
<s> in australia and the united states of america the effective desire of accumulation is strong capital increases fast and the production of food might be very rapidly extended <\s>
<s> but in such countries population also increases with extraordinary rapidity <\s>
<s> their agriculture has to provide for their own expanding numbers as well as for those of the importing countries <\s>
<s> they must therefore from the nature of the case be rapidly driven if not to less fertile at least what is equivalent to remoter and less accessible lands and to modes of cultivation like those of old countries less productive in proportion to the labor and expense <\s>
<s> the extraordinary resources of the united states are scarcely understood even by americans <\s>
<s> xviii see book iv chap <\s>
<s> iii may give some idea of the agricultural possibilities of our land <\s>
<s> it will be seen from this that the quantity of fertile land in but one of our statestexasis greater than that of austria hungary <\s>
<s> but the countries which have at the same time cheap food and great industrial prosperity are few being only those in which the arts of civilized life have been transferred full grown to a rich and uncultivated soil <\s>
<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>
<s> such countries are russia poland and hungary <\s>
<s> the law therefore of diminishing return to industry whenever population makes a more rapid progress than improvement is not solely applicable to countries which are fed from their own soil but in substance applies quite as much to those which are willing to draw their food from any accessible quarter that can afford it cheapest <\s>
<s>    nor by emigration <\s>
<s> besides the importation of corn there is another resource which can be invoked by a nation whose increasing numbers press hard not against their capital but against the productive capacity of their land i mean emigration especially in the form of colonization <\s>
<s> of this remedy the efficacy as far as it goes is real since it consists in seeking elsewhere those unoccupied tracts of fertile land which if they existed at home would enable the demand of an increasing population to be met without any falling off in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> accordingly when the region to be colonized is near at hand and the habits and tastes of the people sufficiently migratory this remedy is completely effectual <\s>
<s> the migration from the older parts of the american confederation to the new territories which is to all intents and purposes colonization is what enables population to go on unchecked throughout the union without having yet diminished the return to industry or increased the difficulty of earning a subsistence <\s>

<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>

<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>

<s> when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase <\s>
<s> one of these expedients is the importation of food from abroad <\s>
<s> the other is emigration <\s>
<s> the admission of cheaper food from a foreign country is equivalent to an agricultural invention by which food could be raised at a similarly diminished cost at home <\s>
<s> it equally increases the productive power of labor <\s>
<s> the return was before so much food for so much labor employed in the growth of food the return is now a greater quantity of food for the same labor employed in producing cottons or hardware or some other commodity to be given in exchange for food <\s>
<s> the one improvement like the other throws back the decline of the productive power of labor by a certain distance but in the one case as in the other it immediately resumes its course the tide which has receded instantly begins to readvance <\s>
<s> it might seem indeed that when a country draws its supply of food from so wide a surface as the whole habitable globe so little impression can be produced on that great expanse by any increase of mouths in one small corner of it that the inhabitants of the country may double and treble their numbers without feeling the effect in any increased tension of the springs of production or any enhancement of the price of food throughout the world <\s>
<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>
<s> in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil <\s>
<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>
<s> the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak <\s>
<s> in australia and the united states of america the effective desire of accumulation is strong capital increases fast and the production of food might be very rapidly extended <\s>
<s> but in such countries population also increases with extraordinary rapidity <\s>
<s> their agriculture has to provide for their own expanding numbers as well as for those of the importing countries <\s>
<s> they must therefore from the nature of the case be rapidly driven if not to less fertile at least what is equivalent to remoter and less accessible lands and to modes of cultivation like those of old countries less productive in proportion to the labor and expense <\s>

<s> xviii see book iv chap <\s>
<s> iii may give some idea of the agricultural possibilities of our land <\s>
<s> it will be seen from this that the quantity of fertile land in but one of our statestexasis greater than that of austria hungary <\s>
<s> but the countries which have at the same time cheap food and great industrial prosperity are few being only those in which the arts of civilized life have been transferred full grown to a rich and uncultivated soil <\s>
<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>
<s> such countries are russia poland and hungary <\s>
<s> the law therefore of diminishing return to industry whenever population makes a more rapid progress than improvement is not solely applicable to countries which are fed from their own soil but in substance applies quite as much to those which are willing to draw their food from any accessible quarter that can afford it cheapest <\s>
<s>    nor by emigration <\s>
<s> besides the importation of corn there is another resource which can be invoked by a nation whose increasing numbers press hard not against their capital but against the productive capacity of their land i mean emigration especially in the form of colonization <\s>
<s> of this remedy the efficacy as far as it goes is real since it consists in seeking elsewhere those unoccupied tracts of fertile land which if they existed at home would enable the demand of an increasing population to be met without any falling off in the productiveness of labor <\s>

<s> the migration from the older parts of the american confederation to the new territories which is to all intents and purposes colonization is what enables population to go on unchecked throughout the union without having yet diminished the return to industry or increased the difficulty of earning a subsistence <\s>

<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>
<s> the word socialism which originated among the english communists and was assumed by them as a name to designate their own doctrine is now on the continent employed in a larger sense not necessarily implying communism or the entire abolition of private property but applied to any system which requires that the land and the instruments of production should be the property not of individuals but of communities or associations or of the government <\s>
<s> it should be said moreover that socialism is to day used in the distinct sense of a system which abolishes private property and places the control of the capital labor and combined industries of the country in the hands of the state <\s>

<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>

<s> when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase <\s>

<s> but in this calculation several things are overlooked <\s>
<s> in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil <\s>
<s> in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost <\s>
<s> the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak <\s>
<s> in australia and the united states of america the effective desire of accumulation is strong capital increases fast and the production of food might be very rapidly extended <\s>
<s> but in such countries population also increases with extraordinary rapidity <\s>

<s> they must therefore from the nature of the case be rapidly driven if not to less fertile at least what is equivalent to remoter and less accessible lands and to modes of cultivation like those of old countries less productive in proportion to the labor and expense <\s>

<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>
<s> such countries are russia poland and hungary <\s>

<s> besides the importation of corn there is another resource which can be invoked by a nation whose increasing numbers press hard not against their capital but against the productive capacity of their land i mean emigration especially in the form of colonization <\s>

<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>

<s> iii may give some idea of the agricultural possibilities of our land <\s>
<s> it will be seen from this that the quantity of fertile land in but one of our statestexasis greater than that of austria hungary <\s>
<s> but the countries which have at the same time cheap food and great industrial prosperity are few being only those in which the arts of civilized life have been transferred full grown to a rich and uncultivated soil <\s>
<s> among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price <\s>
<s> such countries are russia poland and hungary <\s>
<s> the law therefore of diminishing return to industry whenever population makes a more rapid progress than improvement is not solely applicable to countries which are fed from their own soil but in substance applies quite as much to those which are willing to draw their food from any accessible quarter that can afford it cheapest <\s>
<s>    nor by emigration <\s>
<s> besides the importation of corn there is another resource which can be invoked by a nation whose increasing numbers press hard not against their capital but against the productive capacity of their land i mean emigration especially in the form of colonization <\s>
<s> of this remedy the efficacy as far as it goes is real since it consists in seeking elsewhere those unoccupied tracts of fertile land which if they existed at home would enable the demand of an increasing population to be met without any falling off in the productiveness of labor <\s>
<s> accordingly when the region to be colonized is near at hand and the habits and tastes of the people sufficiently migratory this remedy is completely effectual <\s>
<s> the migration from the older parts of the american confederation to the new territories which is to all intents and purposes colonization is what enables population to go on unchecked throughout the union without having yet diminished the return to industry or increased the difficulty of earning a subsistence <\s>
<s> how strictly true this is may be seen by examining the map given in the last census returns 142 showing the residence of the natives of the state of new york <\s>
<s> the greater or less frequency of natives of new york residing in other states is shown by different degrees of shading on the map <\s>
<s> a large district westward as far as the mississippi shows a density of natives of new york of from two to six to a square mile and a lesser density from minnesota to indian territory on the other side of the mississippi <\s>
<s> the same is shown of other older states <\s>
<s> the explanation of the movement can not be anything else than the same as that for the larger movement from europe to america <\s>
<s> there is no probability that even under the most enlightened arrangements in older countries a permanent stream of emigration could be kept up sufficient to take off as in america all that portion of the annual increase when proceeding at its greatest rapidity which being in excess of the progress made during the same short period in the arts of life tends to render living more difficult for every averagely situated individual in the community <\s>
<s> and unless this can be done emigration can not even in an economical point of view dispense with the necessity of checks to population <\s>
<s> the influence of immigration to the united states from european countries in lessening the tension in the relation between food and numbers is one of the most marked events in this century <\s>
<s> the united states has received about one fourth of its total population in 1880 from abroad since the foundation of the republic as will be seen by this table total immigration into the united states <\s>

<s> see united states    statistical abstract    1878 1880 1883 the causes operating on this movement of mena movement unequaled in historyare undoubtedly economic <\s>
<s> like the migration of the early teutonic races from the baltic to southern europe it is due to the pressure of numbers on subsistence <\s>
<s> a still more interesting study is that of the causes which attempt to explain the direction of this stream after it has reached our shores <\s>

<s> individual property and its opponents <\s>
<s> the laws and conditions of the production of wealth partake of the character of physical truths <\s>
<s> there is nothing optional or arbitrary in them <\s>
<s> it is not so with the distribution of wealth <\s>
<s> that is a matter of human institution solely <\s>
<s> the things once there mankind individually or collectively can do with them as they like <\s>
<s> they can place them at the disposal of whomsoever they please and on whatever terms <\s>
<s> the distribution of wealth depends on the laws and customs of society <\s>
<s> the rules by which it is determined are what the opinions and feelings of the ruling portion of the community make them and are very different in different ages and countries and might be still more different if mankind so chose <\s>
<s> we have here to consider not the causes but the consequences of the rules according to which wealth may be distributed <\s>
<s> those at least are as little arbitrary and have as much the character of physical laws as the laws of production <\s>
<s> we proceed then to the consideration of the different modes of distributing the produce of land and labor which have been adopted in practice or may be conceived in theory <\s>
<s> among these our attention is first claimed by that primary and fundamental institution on which unless in some exceptional and very limited cases the economical arrangements of society have always rested though in its secondary features it has varied and is liable to vary <\s>
<s> i mean of course the institution of individual property <\s>
<s> private property as an institution did not owe its origin to any of those considerations of utility which plead for the maintenance of it when established <\s>
<s> enough is known of rude ages both from history and from analogous states of society in our own time to show that tribunals which always precede laws were originally established not to determine rights but to repress violence and terminate quarrels <\s>
<s> with this object chiefly in view they naturally enough gave legal effect to first occupancy by treating as the aggressor the person who first commenced violence by turning or attempting to turn another out of possession <\s>
<s> in considering the institution of property as a question in social philosophy we must leave out of consideration its actual origin in any of the existing nations of europe <\s>
<s> we may suppose a community unhampered by any previous possession a body of colonists occupying for the first time an uninhabited country <\s>
<s> 1 if private property were adopted we must presume that it would be accompanied by none of the initial inequalities and injustice which obstruct the beneficial operation of the principle in old society <\s>
<s> every full grown man or woman we must suppose would be secured in the unfettered use and disposal of his or her bodily and mental faculties and the instruments of production the land and tools would be divided fairly among them so that all might start in respect to outward appliances on equal terms <\s>
<s> it is possible also to conceive that in this original apportionment compensation might be made for the injuries of nature and the balance redressed by assigning to the less robust members of the community advantages in the distribution sufficient to put them on a par with the rest <\s>
<s> but the division once made would not again be interfered with individuals would be left to their own exertions and to the ordinary chances for making an advantageous use of what was assigned to them <\s>
<s> 2 if individual property on the contrary were excluded the plan which must be adopted would be to hold the land and all instruments of production as the joint property of the community and to carry on the operations of industry on the common account <\s>
<s> the direction of the labor of the community would devolve upon a magistrate or magistrates whom we may suppose elected by the suffrages of the community and whom we must assume to be voluntarily obeyed by them <\s>
<s> the division of the produce would in like manner be a public act <\s>
<s> the principle might either be that of complete equality or of apportionment to the necessities or deserts of individuals in whatever manner might be conformable to the ideas of justice or policy prevailing in the community <\s>
<s> the assailants of the principle of individual property may be divided into two classes 1 those whose scheme implies absolute equality in the distribution of the physical means of life and enjoyment and 2 those who admit inequality but grounded on some principle or supposed principle of justice or general expediency and not like so many of the existing social inequalities dependent on accident alone <\s>
<s> the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country <\s>
<s> the word socialism which originated among the english communists and was assumed by them as a name to designate their own doctrine is now on the continent employed in a larger sense not necessarily implying communism or the entire abolition of private property but applied to any system which requires that the land and the instruments of production should be the property not of individuals but of communities or associations or of the government <\s>
<s> it should be said moreover that socialism is to day used in the distinct sense of a system which abolishes private property and places the control of the capital labor and combined industries of the country in the hands of the state <\s>
<s> the essence of modern socialism is the appeal to state help and the weakening of individual self help <\s>
<s> collectivism is also a term now used by german and french writers to describe an organization of the industries of a country under a collective instead of an individual management <\s>
<s> collectivism is but the french expression for the system of state socialism <\s>
<s> the case for communism against private property presented <\s>
<s> the objection ordinarily made to a system of community of property and equal distribution of the produce that each person would be incessantly occupied in evading his fair share of the work points undoubtedly to a real difficulty <\s>
<s> but those who urge this objection forget to how great an extent the same difficulty exists under the system on which nine tenths of the business of society is now conducted <\s>
<s> and though the    masters eye    when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community <\s>
<s> if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all <\s>
