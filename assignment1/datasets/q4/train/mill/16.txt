<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>

<s> in this passage mr <\s>

<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>

<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>

<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>

<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>

<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>

<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>

<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>

<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>

<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>

<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>

<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>

<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>

<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>

<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>

<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>

<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>

<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>

<s> there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless <\s>
<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>

<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>

<s> in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade <\s>
<s> it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others <\s>
<s> but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure <\s>
<s> the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase    the ordinary rate of profit    and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence <\s>
<s> it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount <\s>
<s> the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist <\s>
<s> we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not <\s>
<s> i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined <\s>
<s> i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer <\s>
<s> that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support <\s>
<s> but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise <\s>
<s> the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce <\s>
<s> his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced <\s>
<s> for example if a advances 8,000 bushels of corn to laborers in return for 10,000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of 2,000 yards of cloth <\s>
<s> the ratio of the excess 2,000 to 8,000 the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is not the ratio of 2,000 to 10,000 <\s>
<s> but what do the advances consist of <\s>
<s> it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent <\s>
<s> the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it <\s>
<s> if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor <\s>
<s> a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages <\s>
<s> what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings <\s>
<s> but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials <\s>
<s> he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages <\s>
<s> if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid <\s>
<s> it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part <\s>
<s> the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed <\s>
<s> this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning sheep ranches where the raw materials are produced the shops where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the laborers employed by them <\s>
<s> a line of division may be passed through the returns in all these branches of the industry separating what is wages from what is profit <\s>
<s> then it can be easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single corporation acting for many small capitalists <\s>
<s> the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce <\s>
<s> we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise <\s>
<s> in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording <\s>
<s> instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor <\s>
<s> this is an entirely different question from that concerning the rate of wages before discussed book ii chap <\s>
<s> that had to do with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a country <\s>
<s> an increase of population bringing more laborers to compete for employment will lower the average amount of real wages received by each one and a decrease of population will bring about the reverse <\s>
<s> the rate of wages however now that we are considering the matter from the point of view of the capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting cost of labor <\s>
<s> the former question was one as to the distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by which the total production is greater than the total capital advanced <\s>
<s> since all capital consists of advances to labor the present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the total capital to the total production arising from the use of that capital <\s>
<s> in the diagram before used p <\s>
<s> 179 the question is not how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the relative size of circle b to circle a <\s>
<s> in order to produce circle a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b <\s>
<s> wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so <\s>
<s> for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name <\s>
<s> wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low <\s>
<s> the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest <\s>
<s> this may arise from two causes <\s>
<s> 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient <\s>
<s> the facts presented by mr <\s>
<s> that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter <\s>
<s> there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk <\s>
<s> the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another <\s>
<s> the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment <\s>
<s> the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk <\s>
<s> the profits of a gunpowder manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed <\s>
<s> when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital <\s>
<s> the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr <\s>
<s> mills discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this volume <\s>
<s> the operation of the various elements in changing the amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between different countries and communities who have a different effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the element of interest and risk within the same district where interest is generally the same on the same security profits may vary with the risk attached to different industries and within the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the other two causessince a skillful manager may make a large return a poor one none at all <\s>
<s> or between two employments interest and risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes produce a wide difference <\s>
<s> the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments <\s>
<s> this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries    profit <\s>
<s> there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent <\s>
<s> in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration <\s>
<s> all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital <\s>
<s> in this passage mr <\s>
<s> mill points out distinctly that the movement up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital <\s>
<s> it will be seen that mr <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    gross profit    on the next page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager in the question of profit <\s>
<s> general tendency of profits to an equality <\s>
<s> after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality <\s>
<s> that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment <\s>
<s> the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same <\s>
<s> it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance <\s>
<s> hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time <\s>
<s> that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge <\s>
<s> the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified <\s>
<s> on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages <\s>
<s> by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment <\s>
<s> if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business <\s>
<s> if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored <\s>
<s> illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg and fc joining them this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that in another employment by the amount of a f <\s>
<s> it is not necessary that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c d brings c d to an equality with e b <\s>
<s> this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be <\s>
<s> in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment <\s>
<s> in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades <\s>
<s> even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments <\s>
<s> the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished <\s>
<s> the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital <\s>
<s>    political economists say that capital sets toward the most profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable and non paying trades <\s>
<s> but in ordinary countries this is a slow process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they could not see it <\s>
<s> the process would be visible enough if you could only see the books of the bill brokers and the bankers <\s>
<s> if the iron trade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the number of iron bills at the banks is diminished <\s>
<s> on the other hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes on a sudden profitable immediately    corn bills    are created in large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks <\s>
<s> thus capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its level    177 in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out <\s>
