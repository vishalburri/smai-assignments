<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> in the present society the means of work are the monopoly of the class of capitalists <\s>

<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> in this there is no choice of work and the tyranny of one master would be supplanted by the tyranny of a greater multiplex master in the officers of government <\s>
<s> moreover it can not be admitted that exchange value is determined by the quantity of labor alone <\s>

<s> it follows from this that the right of property in the article vests wholly in the laborer while the capitalist if he claims a share of the product is nothing less than a robber <\s>
<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> another of the objections to communism is that if every member of the community were assured of subsistence for himself and any number of children on the sole condition of willingness to work prudential restraint on the multiplication of mankind would be at an end and population would start forward at a rate which would reduce the community through successive stages of increasing discomfort to actual starvation <\s>
<s> but communism is precisely the state of things in which opinion might be expected to declare itself with greatest intensity against this kind of selfish intemperance <\s>
<s> an augmentation of numbers which diminished the comfort or increased the toil of the mass would then cause which now it does not immediate and unmistakable inconvenience to every individual in the association inconvenience which could not then be imputed to the avarice of employers or the unjust privileges of the rich <\s>

<s> to judge of the final destination of the institution of property we must suppose everything rectified which causes the institution to work in a manner opposed to that equitable principle of proportion between remuneration and exertion on which in every vindication of it that will bear the light it is assumed to be grounded <\s>

<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> in the present society the means of work are the monopoly of the class of capitalists <\s>

<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> in this there is no choice of work and the tyranny of one master would be supplanted by the tyranny of a greater multiplex master in the officers of government <\s>
<s> moreover it can not be admitted that exchange value is determined by the quantity of labor alone <\s>

<s> it follows from this that the right of property in the article vests wholly in the laborer while the capitalist if he claims a share of the product is nothing less than a robber <\s>
<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> another of the objections to communism is that if every member of the community were assured of subsistence for himself and any number of children on the sole condition of willingness to work prudential restraint on the multiplication of mankind would be at an end and population would start forward at a rate which would reduce the community through successive stages of increasing discomfort to actual starvation <\s>
<s> but communism is precisely the state of things in which opinion might be expected to declare itself with greatest intensity against this kind of selfish intemperance <\s>
<s> an augmentation of numbers which diminished the comfort or increased the toil of the mass would then cause which now it does not immediate and unmistakable inconvenience to every individual in the association inconvenience which could not then be imputed to the avarice of employers or the unjust privileges of the rich <\s>

<s> to judge of the final destination of the institution of property we must suppose everything rectified which causes the institution to work in a manner opposed to that equitable principle of proportion between remuneration and exertion on which in every vindication of it that will bear the light it is assumed to be grounded <\s>

<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> in the present society the means of work are the monopoly of the class of capitalists <\s>

<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> in this there is no choice of work and the tyranny of one master would be supplanted by the tyranny of a greater multiplex master in the officers of government <\s>
<s> moreover it can not be admitted that exchange value is determined by the quantity of labor alone <\s>

<s> it follows from this that the right of property in the article vests wholly in the laborer while the capitalist if he claims a share of the product is nothing less than a robber <\s>
<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>

<s> another of the objections to communism is that if every member of the community were assured of subsistence for himself and any number of children on the sole condition of willingness to work prudential restraint on the multiplication of mankind would be at an end and population would start forward at a rate which would reduce the community through successive stages of increasing discomfort to actual starvation <\s>
<s> but communism is precisely the state of things in which opinion might be expected to declare itself with greatest intensity against this kind of selfish intemperance <\s>
<s> an augmentation of numbers which diminished the comfort or increased the toil of the mass would then cause which now it does not immediate and unmistakable inconvenience to every individual in the association inconvenience which could not then be imputed to the avarice of employers or the unjust privileges of the rich <\s>

<s> to judge of the final destination of the institution of property we must suppose everything rectified which causes the institution to work in a manner opposed to that equitable principle of proportion between remuneration and exertion on which in every vindication of it that will bear the light it is assumed to be grounded <\s>

<s>    the attacks 160 on the present social order are vigorous and earnest but open to the charge of exaggeration <\s>

<s> there are occasionally branches of industry which are being gradually superseded by something else and in those until production accommodates itself to demand wages are depressed <\s>
<s>    m <\s>
<s> louis blanc appears to have fallen into the same error which was at first committed by malthus and his followers that of supposing because population has a greater power of increase than subsistence its pressure upon subsistence must be always growing more severe <\s>
<s> it is a great point gained for truth when it comes to be seen that the tendency to over population is a fact which communism as well as the existing order of society would have to deal with <\s>
<s> another of the objections to communism is that if every member of the community were assured of subsistence for himself and any number of children on the sole condition of willingness to work prudential restraint on the multiplication of mankind would be at an end and population would start forward at a rate which would reduce the community through successive stages of increasing discomfort to actual starvation <\s>
<s> but communism is precisely the state of things in which opinion might be expected to declare itself with greatest intensity against this kind of selfish intemperance <\s>
<s> an augmentation of numbers which diminished the comfort or increased the toil of the mass would then cause which now it does not immediate and unmistakable inconvenience to every individual in the association inconvenience which could not then be imputed to the avarice of employers or the unjust privileges of the rich <\s>
<s> a more real difficulty is that of fairly apportioning the labor of the community among its members <\s>
<s> there are many kinds of work and by what standard are they to be measured one against another <\s>
<s> who is to judge how much cotton spinning or distributing goods from the stores or brick laying or chimney sweeping is equivalent to so much plowing <\s>
<s> besides even in the same kind of work nominal equality of labor would be so great a real inequality that the feeling of justice would revolt against its being enforced <\s>
<s> all persons are not equally fit for all labor and the same quantity of labor is an unequal burden on the weak and the strong the hardy and the delicate the quick and the slow the dull and the intelligent 146 if therefore the choice were to be made between communism with all its chances and the present state of society with all its sufferings and injustices all the difficulties great or small of communism would be but as dust in the balance <\s>
<s> but to make the comparison applicable we must compare communism at its best with the r  gime of individual property not as it is but as it might be made <\s>
<s> the laws of property have never yet conformed to the principles on which the justification of private property rests <\s>
<s> they have made property of things which never ought to be property and absolute property where only a qualified property ought to exist <\s>
<s> private property in every defense made of it is supposed to mean the guarantee to individuals of the fruits of their own labor and abstinence <\s>
<s> the guarantee to them of the fruits of the labor and abstinence of others transmitted to them without any merit or exertion of their own is not of the essence of the institution but a mere incidental consequence which when it reaches a certain height does not promote but conflicts with the ends which render private property legitimate <\s>
<s> to judge of the final destination of the institution of property we must suppose everything rectified which causes the institution to work in a manner opposed to that equitable principle of proportion between remuneration and exertion on which in every vindication of it that will bear the light it is assumed to be grounded <\s>
<s> we must also suppose two conditions realized without which neither communism nor any other laws or institutions could make the condition of the mass of mankind other than degraded and miserable <\s>
<s> one of these conditions is universal education the other a due limitation of the numbers of the community <\s>
<s> with these there could be no poverty even under the present social institutions and these being supposed the question of socialism is not as generally stated by socialists a question of flying to the sole refuge against the evils which now bear down humanity but a mere question of comparative advantages which futurity must determine <\s>
<s> we are too ignorant either of what individual agency in its best form or socialism in its best form can accomplish to be qualified to decide which of the two will be the ultimate form of human society <\s>
<s> if a conjecture may be hazarded the decision will probably depend mainly on one consideration viz which of the two systems is consistent with the greatest amount of human liberty and spontaneity <\s>
<s> it is yet to be ascertained whether the communistic scheme would be consistent with that multiform development of human nature those manifold unlikenesses that diversity of tastes and talents and variety of intellectual points of view which not only form a great part of the interest of human life but by bringing intellects into stimulating collision and by presenting to each innumerable notions that he would not have conceived of himself are the mainspring of mental and moral progression <\s>
<s> the socialists who appeal to state help <\s>
<s> for general purposes a clearer understanding of the various schemes may be gained by observing that 1 one class of socialists intend to include the state itself within their plan and 2 another class aim to form separate communities inside the state and under its protection <\s>
<s> of this first system there are no present examples but the object of most of the socialistic organizations in the united states and europe is to strive for the assumption by the state of the production and distribution of wealth 147 at present the most active socialists are to be found in germany <\s>
<s> the origin of this influence however is to be traced to france 148 louis blanc 149 in his    organisation du travail    considers property the great scourge of society <\s>
<s> the government he asserts should regulate production raise money to be appropriated without interest for creating state workshops in which the workmen should elect their own overseers and all receive the same wages and the sums needed should be raised from the abolition of collateral inheritance <\s>
<s> the important practical part of his scheme was that the great state workshops aided by the government would make private competition in those industries impossible and thus bring about the change from the private to the socialistic system <\s>
<s> the founder of modern german socialism was karl marx 150 and almost the only socialist who pretended to economic knowledge <\s>
<s> he aimed his attack on the present social system against the question of value by asserting that the amount of labor necessary for the production of an article is the sole measure of its exchange value <\s>
<s> it follows from this that the right of property in the article vests wholly in the laborer while the capitalist if he claims a share of the product is nothing less than a robber <\s>
<s> no just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the elements of production land tools materials and all existing appliances which involves of course the destruction of the institution of private property <\s>
<s> an obvious weakness in this scheme is the provision that the government should determine what goods are to be produced and that every one is bound to perform that work which is assigned by the state <\s>
<s> in this there is no choice of work and the tyranny of one master would be supplanted by the tyranny of a greater multiplex master in the officers of government <\s>
<s> moreover it can not be admitted that exchange value is determined by the quantity of labor alone <\s>
<s> every one knows that the result of ten days    labor of a skilled watch maker does not exchange for the result of ten days    labor of an unskilled hodman <\s>
<s> of two men making shoes one may produce a good the other a poor article although both may work the same length of time so that their exchange value ought not to be determined by the mere quantity of labor expended <\s>
<s> above all marx would extend the equality of wages for the same time to the manager and superintendent also <\s>
<s> in other words he proposes to take away all the incentives to the acquirement or exercise of superior and signal ability in every work of life the result of which would inevitably lead to a deadening extension of mediocrity <\s>
<s> this system gained an undue attention because it was made the instrument of a socialist propaganda under the leadership of ferdinand lassalle 151 this active leader in 1863 founded the german    workingmens union    a year earlier than the    international 152 association    in 1869 liebknecht and his friends established the    social democratic workingmens party    which after some difficulties absorbed the followers of lassalle in a congress at gotha in 1875 and form the present socialist party in germany <\s>
<s> their programme 153 as announced at gotha is as follows i <\s>
<s> labor is the source of all riches and of all culture <\s>
<s> as general profitable labor can only be done by the human society the whole product of labor belongs to societyi e to all its memberswho have the same duties and the same right to work each according to his reasonable wants <\s>
<s> in the present society the means of work are the monopoly of the class of capitalists <\s>
<s> the class of workingmen thus become dependent on them and consequently are given over to all degrees of misery and servitude <\s>
<s> in order to emancipate labor it is requisite that the means of work be transformed into the common property of society that all production be regulated by associations and that the entire product of labor be turned over to society and justly distributed for the benefit of all <\s>
<s> none but the working class itself can emancipate labor as in relation to it all other classes are only a reactionary mass <\s>
<s> led by these principles the german social workingmens party by all legal means strives for a free state and society the breaking down of the iron laws of wages by abolishing the system of hired workingmen by abolishing exploitation in every shape and doing away with all social and political inequality <\s>
<s> the german social workingmens party although first working within its national confines is fully conscious of the international character of the general workingmens movement and is resolved to fulfill all duties which it imposes on each workingman in order to realize the fraternity of all men <\s>
<s> the german social workingmens party for the purpose of preparing the way and for the solution of the social problem demands the creation of social productive associations to be supported by the state government and under the control of the working people <\s>
<s> the productive associations are to be founded in such numbers that the social organization of the whole production can be effected by them <\s>
<s> the german social workingmens party requires as the basis of state government 1 <\s>
<s> universal equal direct and secret suffrage which beginning with the twentieth year obliges all citizens to vote in all state county and town elections <\s>
<s> election day must be a sunday or a holiday <\s>
<s> direct legislation by the people decision as to war and peace by the people <\s>
<s> general capability of bearing arms popular defense in place of standing armies <\s>
<s> abolition of all exceptional laws especially those relating to the press public meetings and associationsin short of all laws which hinder the free expression of ideas and thought <\s>
<s> gratuitous administration of justice by the people <\s>
<s> general and equal popular and gratuitous education by the government in all classes and institutes of learning general duty to attend school religion to be declared a private affair <\s>
<s> the german social workingmens party insists on realizing in the present state of society 1 <\s>
<s> the largest possible extension of political rights and freedom in conformity to the above six demands <\s>
<s> a single progressive income tax for state counties and towns instead of those which are imposed at present and in place of indirect taxes which unequally burden the people <\s>
<s> unlimited right of combination <\s>
<s> a normal working day corresponding with the wants of society prohibition of sunday labor <\s>
<s> prohibition of childrens work and of womens work so far as it injures their health and morality <\s>
<s> protective laws for the life and health of workingmen sanitary control of their dwellings superintendence of mines factories industry and home work by officers chosen by the workingmen an effectual law guaranteeing the responsibility of employers <\s>
<s> unrestricted self government of all banks established for the mutual assistance of workingmen <\s>
<s> the above scheme also represents very well the character of the socialist agitators in the united states who are themselves chiefly foreigners and have foreign conceptions of socialism <\s>
<s> on this form of socialism it is interesting to have mr <\s>
<s> mills later opinions 154 in his own words <\s>
<s>    among those who call themselves socialists two kinds of persons may be distinguished <\s>
<s> there are in the first place 1 those whose plans for a new order of society in which private property and individual competition are to be superseded and other motives to action substituted are on the scale of a village community or township and would be applied to an entire country by the multiplication of such self acting units of this character are the systems of owen of fourier and the more thoughtful and philosophic socialists generally <\s>
<s> the other class 2 who are more a product of the continent than of great britain and may be called the revolutionary socialists propose to themselves a much bolder stroke <\s>
<s> their scheme is the management of the whole productive resources of the country by one central authority the general government <\s>
