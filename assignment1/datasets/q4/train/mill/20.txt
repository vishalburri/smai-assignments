<s> we have investigated the laws which determine the value of two classes of commoditiesthe small class which being limited to a definite quantity have their value entirely determined by demand and supply save that their cost of production if they have any constitutes a minimum below which they can not permanently fall and the large class which can be multiplied ad libitum by labor and capital and of which the cost of production fixes the maximum as well as the minimum at which they can permanently exchange if there be free competition <\s>
<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>
<s> at that price however society can go on for some time longer could go on perhaps forever if population did not increase <\s>
<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>
<s> whatever surplus any portion of agricultural capital produces beyond what is produced by the same amount of capital on the worst soil or under the most expensive mode of cultivation which the existing demands of society compel a recourse to that surplus will naturally be paid as rent from that capital to the owner of the land on which it is employed <\s>

<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>

<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>

<s> we have investigated the laws which determine the value of two classes of commoditiesthe small class which being limited to a definite quantity have their value entirely determined by demand and supply save that their cost of production if they have any constitutes a minimum below which they can not permanently fall and the large class which can be multiplied ad libitum by labor and capital and of which the cost of production fixes the maximum as well as the minimum at which they can permanently exchange if there be free competition <\s>
<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>

<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>

<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>

<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>

<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>

<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>

<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>

<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>

<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>

<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>

<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>

<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>

<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>

<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>

<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>

<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>

<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>

<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>

<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>

<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>

<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>

<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>

<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>

<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>

<s> the universal elements of cost of production are the wages of the labor and the profits of the capital <\s>
<s> the occasional elements are taxes and any extra cost occasioned by a scarcity value of some of the requisites <\s>
<s> besides the natural and necessary elements in cost of productionlabor and profitsthere are others which are artificial and casual as for instance a tax <\s>
<s> the taxes on hops and malt are as much a part of the cost of production of those articles as the wages of the laborers <\s>
<s> the expenses which the law imposes as well as those which the nature of things imposes must be reimbursed with the ordinary profit from the value of the produce or the things will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> but the influence of taxation on value is subject to the same conditions as the influence of wages and of profits <\s>
<s> it is not general taxation but differential taxation that produces the effect <\s>
<s> if all productions were taxed so as to take an equal percentage from all profits relative values would be in no way disturbed <\s>
<s> if only a few commodities were taxed their value would rise and if only a few were left untaxed their value would fall <\s>
<s> but the case in which scarcity value chiefly operates in adding to cost of production is the case of natural agents <\s>
<s> these when unappropriated and to be had for the taking do not enter into the cost of production save to the extent of the labor which may be necessary to fit them for use <\s>
<s> even when appropriated they do not as we have already seen bear a value from the mere fact of the appropriation but only from scarcitythat is from limitation of supply <\s>
<s> but it is equally certain that they often do bear a scarcity value <\s>
<s> no one can deny that rent sometimes enters into cost of production of other than agricultural products <\s>
<s> if i buy or rent a piece of ground and build a cloth manufactory on it the ground rent forms legitimately a part of my expenses of production which must be repaid by the product <\s>
<s> and since all factories are built on ground and most of them in places where ground is peculiarly valuable the rent paid for it must on the average be compensated in the values of all things made in factories <\s>
<s> in what sense it is true that rent does not enter into the cost of production or affect the value of agricultural produce will be shown in the succeeding chapter <\s>
<s> these occasional elements in cost of production such as taxes insurance ground rent etc are to be considered as just so much of an increase in the quantity of capital required for the operation involved in the particular production and consequently result in an increased cost of production because there is either more abstinence or abstinence for a longer time to be rewarded <\s>
<s> these elements therefore if they are not universal or common to all articles will affect the exchange value of commodities wherever there is a free competition <\s>
<s> of rent in its relation to value <\s>
<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication but not without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances <\s>
<s> we have investigated the laws which determine the value of two classes of commoditiesthe small class which being limited to a definite quantity have their value entirely determined by demand and supply save that their cost of production if they have any constitutes a minimum below which they can not permanently fall and the large class which can be multiplied ad libitum by labor and capital and of which the cost of production fixes the maximum as well as the minimum at which they can permanently exchange if there be free competition <\s>
<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>
<s> at that price however society can go on for some time longer could go on perhaps forever if population did not increase <\s>
<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>
<s> whatever surplus any portion of agricultural capital produces beyond what is produced by the same amount of capital on the worst soil or under the most expensive mode of cultivation which the existing demands of society compel a recourse to that surplus will naturally be paid as rent from that capital to the owner of the land on which it is employed <\s>

<s> this we now see to be erroneous <\s>
<s> a thing can not be at a monopoly value when its supply can be increased to an indefinite extent if we are only willing to incur the cost <\s>
<s> as long as there is any land fit for cultivation which at the existing price can not be profitably cultivated at all there must be some land a little better which will yield the ordinary profit but allow nothing for rent and that land if within the boundary of a farm will be cultivated by the farmer if not so probably by the proprietor or by some other person on sufferance <\s>

<s> the wine and the cloth were made by the same original outlay <\s>
<s> here then is a case in which the natural values relatively to one another of two commodities do not conform to their cost of production alone but to their cost of production plus something elseunless indeed for the sake of generality in the expression we include the profit which the wine merchant foregoes during the five years in the cost of production of the wine looking upon it as a kind of additional outlay over and above his other advances for which outlay he must be indemnified at last <\s>

<s> the same explanation also holds good in the following illustration all commodities made by machinery are assimilated at least approximately to the wine in the preceding example <\s>
<s> in comparison with things made wholly by immediate labor profits enter more largely into their cost of production <\s>
<s> suppose two commodities a and b each requiring a year for its production by means of a capital which we will on this occasion denote by money and suppose it to be   1,000 <\s>
<s> a is made wholly by immediate labor the whole   1,000 being expended directly in wages <\s>
<s> b is made by means of labor which cost   500 and a machine which cost   500 and the machine is worn out by one years use <\s>
<s> the two commodities will be of exactly the same value which if computed in money and if profits are 20 per cent per annum will be   1,200 <\s>

<s> so that in the case of a only one sixth of the entire return is profit while in b the element of profit comprises not only a sixth of the whole but an additional sixth of a large part <\s>
<s> from the unequal proportion in which in different employments profits enter into the advances of the capitalist and therefore into the returns required by him two consequences follow in regard to value <\s>
<s> one is that commodities do not exchange in the ratio simply of the quantities of labor required to produce them not even if we allow for the unequal rates at which different kinds of labor are permanently remunerated <\s>
<s> 2 a second consequence is that every rise or fall of general profits will have an effect on values <\s>
<s> not indeed by raising or lowering them generally which as we have so often said is a contradiction and an impossibility but by altering the proportion in which the values of things are affected by the unequal lengths of time for which profit is due <\s>

<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>

<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>

<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>

<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>

<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>

<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>

<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>

<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>

<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>

<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>

<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>

<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>

<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>

<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>

<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>

<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>

<s> a thing can not be at a monopoly value when its supply can be increased to an indefinite extent if we are only willing to incur the cost <\s>
<s> as long as there is any land fit for cultivation which at the existing price can not be profitably cultivated at all there must be some land a little better which will yield the ordinary profit but allow nothing for rent and that land if within the boundary of a farm will be cultivated by the farmer if not so probably by the proprietor or by some other person on sufferance <\s>

<s> the same explanation also holds good in the following illustration all commodities made by machinery are assimilated at least approximately to the wine in the preceding example <\s>
<s> in comparison with things made wholly by immediate labor profits enter more largely into their cost of production <\s>

<s> so that in the case of a only one sixth of the entire return is profit while in b the element of profit comprises not only a sixth of the whole but an additional sixth of a large part <\s>
<s> from the unequal proportion in which in different employments profits enter into the advances of the capitalist and therefore into the returns required by him two consequences follow in regard to value <\s>
<s> one is that commodities do not exchange in the ratio simply of the quantities of labor required to produce them not even if we allow for the unequal rates at which different kinds of labor are permanently remunerated <\s>
<s> 2 a second consequence is that every rise or fall of general profits will have an effect on values <\s>
<s> not indeed by raising or lowering them generally which as we have so often said is a contradiction and an impossibility but by altering the proportion in which the values of things are affected by the unequal lengths of time for which profit is due <\s>

<s> it follows from this that even a general rise of wages when it involves a real increase in the cost of labor does in some degree influence values <\s>
<s> it does not affect them in the manner vulgarly supposed by raising them universally but an increase in the cost of labor lowers profits and therefore lowers in natural values the things into which profits enter in a greater proportion than the average and raises those into which they enter in a less proportion than the average <\s>

<s> we have investigated the laws which determine the value of two classes of commoditiesthe small class which being limited to a definite quantity have their value entirely determined by demand and supply save that their cost of production if they have any constitutes a minimum below which they can not permanently fall and the large class which can be multiplied ad libitum by labor and capital and of which the cost of production fixes the maximum as well as the minimum at which they can permanently exchange if there be free competition <\s>
<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>
<s> at that price however society can go on for some time longer could go on perhaps forever if population did not increase <\s>
<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>
<s> whatever surplus any portion of agricultural capital produces beyond what is produced by the same amount of capital on the worst soil or under the most expensive mode of cultivation which the existing demands of society compel a recourse to that surplus will naturally be paid as rent from that capital to the owner of the land on which it is employed <\s>

<s> this we now see to be erroneous <\s>
<s> a thing can not be at a monopoly value when its supply can be increased to an indefinite extent if we are only willing to incur the cost <\s>
<s> as long as there is any land fit for cultivation which at the existing price can not be profitably cultivated at all there must be some land a little better which will yield the ordinary profit but allow nothing for rent and that land if within the boundary of a farm will be cultivated by the farmer if not so probably by the proprietor or by some other person on sufferance <\s>

<s> rent therefore forms no part of the cost of production which determines the value of agricultural produce <\s>

<s> the wine and the cloth were made by the same original outlay <\s>
<s> here then is a case in which the natural values relatively to one another of two commodities do not conform to their cost of production alone but to their cost of production plus something elseunless indeed for the sake of generality in the expression we include the profit which the wine merchant foregoes during the five years in the cost of production of the wine looking upon it as a kind of additional outlay over and above his other advances for which outlay he must be indemnified at last <\s>

<s> if there is a free movement of labor and capital between the two industries they will exchange for each other in proportion to the sacrifices involved so that the wine would exchange for more of cloth because there was more sacrifice undergone <\s>
<s> the same explanation also holds good in the following illustration all commodities made by machinery are assimilated at least approximately to the wine in the preceding example <\s>
<s> in comparison with things made wholly by immediate labor profits enter more largely into their cost of production <\s>
<s> suppose two commodities a and b each requiring a year for its production by means of a capital which we will on this occasion denote by money and suppose it to be   1,000 <\s>
<s> a is made wholly by immediate labor the whole   1,000 being expended directly in wages <\s>
<s> b is made by means of labor which cost   500 and a machine which cost   500 and the machine is worn out by one years use <\s>
<s> the two commodities will be of exactly the same value which if computed in money and if profits are 20 per cent per annum will be   1,200 <\s>
<s> but of this   1,200 in the case of a only   200 or one sixth is profit while in the case of b there is not only the   200 but as much of   500 the price of the machine as consisted of the profits of the machine maker which if we suppose the machine also to have taken a year for its production is again one sixth <\s>
<s> so that in the case of a only one sixth of the entire return is profit while in b the element of profit comprises not only a sixth of the whole but an additional sixth of a large part <\s>
<s> from the unequal proportion in which in different employments profits enter into the advances of the capitalist and therefore into the returns required by him two consequences follow in regard to value <\s>
<s> one is that commodities do not exchange in the ratio simply of the quantities of labor required to produce them not even if we allow for the unequal rates at which different kinds of labor are permanently remunerated <\s>
<s> 2 a second consequence is that every rise or fall of general profits will have an effect on values <\s>
<s> not indeed by raising or lowering them generally which as we have so often said is a contradiction and an impossibility but by altering the proportion in which the values of things are affected by the unequal lengths of time for which profit is due <\s>
<s> when two things though made by equal labor are of unequal value because the one is called upon to yield profit for a greater number of years or months than the other this difference of value will be greater when profits are greater and less when they are less <\s>
<s> the wine which has to yield five years    profit more than the cloth will surpass it in value much more if profits are forty per cent than if they are only twenty <\s>
<s> it follows from this that even a general rise of wages when it involves a real increase in the cost of labor does in some degree influence values <\s>
<s> it does not affect them in the manner vulgarly supposed by raising them universally but an increase in the cost of labor lowers profits and therefore lowers in natural values the things into which profits enter in a greater proportion than the average and raises those into which they enter in a less proportion than the average <\s>

<s> the universal elements of cost of production are the wages of the labor and the profits of the capital <\s>
<s> the occasional elements are taxes and any extra cost occasioned by a scarcity value of some of the requisites <\s>
<s> besides the natural and necessary elements in cost of productionlabor and profitsthere are others which are artificial and casual as for instance a tax <\s>
<s> the taxes on hops and malt are as much a part of the cost of production of those articles as the wages of the laborers <\s>
<s> the expenses which the law imposes as well as those which the nature of things imposes must be reimbursed with the ordinary profit from the value of the produce or the things will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> but the influence of taxation on value is subject to the same conditions as the influence of wages and of profits <\s>
<s> it is not general taxation but differential taxation that produces the effect <\s>
<s> if all productions were taxed so as to take an equal percentage from all profits relative values would be in no way disturbed <\s>
<s> if only a few commodities were taxed their value would rise and if only a few were left untaxed their value would fall <\s>

<s> but there is still a third kind of commodities to be consideredthose which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost <\s>
<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>
<s> at that price however society can go on for some time longer could go on perhaps forever if population did not increase <\s>
<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>
<s> whatever surplus any portion of agricultural capital produces beyond what is produced by the same amount of capital on the worst soil or under the most expensive mode of cultivation which the existing demands of society compel a recourse to that surplus will naturally be paid as rent from that capital to the owner of the land on which it is employed <\s>

<s> this we now see to be erroneous <\s>
<s> a thing can not be at a monopoly value when its supply can be increased to an indefinite extent if we are only willing to incur the cost <\s>
<s> as long as there is any land fit for cultivation which at the existing price can not be profitably cultivated at all there must be some land a little better which will yield the ordinary profit but allow nothing for rent and that land if within the boundary of a farm will be cultivated by the farmer if not so probably by the proprietor or by some other person on sufferance <\s>

<s> rent therefore forms no part of the cost of production which determines the value of agricultural produce <\s>

<s> the wine and the cloth were made by the same original outlay <\s>
<s> here then is a case in which the natural values relatively to one another of two commodities do not conform to their cost of production alone but to their cost of production plus something elseunless indeed for the sake of generality in the expression we include the profit which the wine merchant foregoes during the five years in the cost of production of the wine looking upon it as a kind of additional outlay over and above his other advances for which outlay he must be indemnified at last <\s>

<s> if there is a free movement of labor and capital between the two industries they will exchange for each other in proportion to the sacrifices involved so that the wine would exchange for more of cloth because there was more sacrifice undergone <\s>
<s> the same explanation also holds good in the following illustration all commodities made by machinery are assimilated at least approximately to the wine in the preceding example <\s>
<s> in comparison with things made wholly by immediate labor profits enter more largely into their cost of production <\s>
<s> suppose two commodities a and b each requiring a year for its production by means of a capital which we will on this occasion denote by money and suppose it to be   1,000 <\s>
<s> a is made wholly by immediate labor the whole   1,000 being expended directly in wages <\s>
<s> b is made by means of labor which cost   500 and a machine which cost   500 and the machine is worn out by one years use <\s>
<s> the two commodities will be of exactly the same value which if computed in money and if profits are 20 per cent per annum will be   1,200 <\s>
<s> but of this   1,200 in the case of a only   200 or one sixth is profit while in the case of b there is not only the   200 but as much of   500 the price of the machine as consisted of the profits of the machine maker which if we suppose the machine also to have taken a year for its production is again one sixth <\s>
<s> so that in the case of a only one sixth of the entire return is profit while in b the element of profit comprises not only a sixth of the whole but an additional sixth of a large part <\s>
<s> from the unequal proportion in which in different employments profits enter into the advances of the capitalist and therefore into the returns required by him two consequences follow in regard to value <\s>
<s> one is that commodities do not exchange in the ratio simply of the quantities of labor required to produce them not even if we allow for the unequal rates at which different kinds of labor are permanently remunerated <\s>
<s> 2 a second consequence is that every rise or fall of general profits will have an effect on values <\s>
<s> not indeed by raising or lowering them generally which as we have so often said is a contradiction and an impossibility but by altering the proportion in which the values of things are affected by the unequal lengths of time for which profit is due <\s>
<s> when two things though made by equal labor are of unequal value because the one is called upon to yield profit for a greater number of years or months than the other this difference of value will be greater when profits are greater and less when they are less <\s>
<s> the wine which has to yield five years    profit more than the cloth will surpass it in value much more if profits are forty per cent than if they are only twenty <\s>
<s> it follows from this that even a general rise of wages when it involves a real increase in the cost of labor does in some degree influence values <\s>
<s> it does not affect them in the manner vulgarly supposed by raising them universally but an increase in the cost of labor lowers profits and therefore lowers in natural values the things into which profits enter in a greater proportion than the average and raises those into which they enter in a less proportion than the average <\s>

<s> the occasional elements are taxes and any extra cost occasioned by a scarcity value of some of the requisites <\s>
<s> besides the natural and necessary elements in cost of productionlabor and profitsthere are others which are artificial and casual as for instance a tax <\s>
<s> the taxes on hops and malt are as much a part of the cost of production of those articles as the wages of the laborers <\s>

<s> but the influence of taxation on value is subject to the same conditions as the influence of wages and of profits <\s>
<s> it is not general taxation but differential taxation that produces the effect <\s>

<s> these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others <\s>
<s> the principal of them is agricultural produce <\s>
<s> we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first <\s>
<s> where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply <\s>
<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>
<s> at that price however society can go on for some time longer could go on perhaps forever if population did not increase <\s>
<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>
<s> whatever surplus any portion of agricultural capital produces beyond what is produced by the same amount of capital on the worst soil or under the most expensive mode of cultivation which the existing demands of society compel a recourse to that surplus will naturally be paid as rent from that capital to the owner of the land on which it is employed <\s>

<s> this we now see to be erroneous <\s>
<s> a thing can not be at a monopoly value when its supply can be increased to an indefinite extent if we are only willing to incur the cost <\s>
<s> as long as there is any land fit for cultivation which at the existing price can not be profitably cultivated at all there must be some land a little better which will yield the ordinary profit but allow nothing for rent and that land if within the boundary of a farm will be cultivated by the farmer if not so probably by the proprietor or by some other person on sufferance <\s>

<s> the same explanation also holds good in the following illustration all commodities made by machinery are assimilated at least approximately to the wine in the preceding example <\s>
<s> in comparison with things made wholly by immediate labor profits enter more largely into their cost of production <\s>
<s> suppose two commodities a and b each requiring a year for its production by means of a capital which we will on this occasion denote by money and suppose it to be   1,000 <\s>

<s> b is made by means of labor which cost   500 and a machine which cost   500 and the machine is worn out by one years use <\s>

<s> so that in the case of a only one sixth of the entire return is profit while in b the element of profit comprises not only a sixth of the whole but an additional sixth of a large part <\s>
<s> from the unequal proportion in which in different employments profits enter into the advances of the capitalist and therefore into the returns required by him two consequences follow in regard to value <\s>
<s> one is that commodities do not exchange in the ratio simply of the quantities of labor required to produce them not even if we allow for the unequal rates at which different kinds of labor are permanently remunerated <\s>
<s> 2 a second consequence is that every rise or fall of general profits will have an effect on values <\s>
<s> not indeed by raising or lowering them generally which as we have so often said is a contradiction and an impossibility but by altering the proportion in which the values of things are affected by the unequal lengths of time for which profit is due <\s>
<s> when two things though made by equal labor are of unequal value because the one is called upon to yield profit for a greater number of years or months than the other this difference of value will be greater when profits are greater and less when they are less <\s>
<s> the wine which has to yield five years    profit more than the cloth will surpass it in value much more if profits are forty per cent than if they are only twenty <\s>
<s> it follows from this that even a general rise of wages when it involves a real increase in the cost of labor does in some degree influence values <\s>
<s> it does not affect them in the manner vulgarly supposed by raising them universally but an increase in the cost of labor lowers profits and therefore lowers in natural values the things into which profits enter in a greater proportion than the average and raises those into which they enter in a less proportion than the average <\s>

<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>

<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>

<s> if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply <\s>
<s> but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it <\s>
<s> we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply <\s>
<s> by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one <\s>
<s> neither of these things will be done without a rise in price <\s>
<s> this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand <\s>
<s> so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value <\s>
<s> suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality <\s>
<s> if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced <\s>
<s> at that price however society can go on for some time longer could go on perhaps forever if population did not increase <\s>
<s> the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance ); nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production <\s>
<s> in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production <\s>
<s> though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is self evident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land <\s>
<s> it is equally true if they are produced on the same land <\s>
<s> suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it <\s>
<s> the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural pricethan the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production <\s>
<s> if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest <\s>
<s> we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower <\s>
<s> the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense <\s>
<s> this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided <\s>
<s> such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost <\s>
<s> if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production <\s>
<s> the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use <\s>
<s> we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book <\s>
<s> rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil <\s>
<s> whatever surplus any portion of agricultural capital produces beyond what is produced by the same amount of capital on the worst soil or under the most expensive mode of cultivation which the existing demands of society compel a recourse to that surplus will naturally be paid as rent from that capital to the owner of the land on which it is employed <\s>
<s> the discussion of rent is here followed wholly from the point of view of value while before book ii chap <\s>
<s> vi the law of rent was reached through a limitation of the quantity of land due to the influence of population <\s>
<s> in the former case the rent and produce were stated in bushels <\s>
<s> by introducing price now as the convenient symbol of value instead of the separate increased demands of population in our illustration than used p <\s>
<s> 240 it will be seen how the same operation looking at it solely in respect to value brings us to the same law price a b c d per bushel <\s>
<s> 24 18 12 6 bushels bushels bushels bushels total rent <\s>
<s> total value of value of value of value of product <\s>
<s> 1.00 24.00 0.00 .... <\s>
<s> 1.33 32.00 8.00 24.00 0.00 .... <\s>
<s> 2.00 48.00 24.00 36.00 12.00 24.00 0.00 .... <\s>
<s> 4.00 96.00 72.00 72.00 48.00 48.00 24.00 24.00 it was long thought by political economists among the rest even by adam smith that the produce of land is always at a monopoly value because they said in addition to the ordinary rate of profit it always yields something further for rent <\s>
<s> this we now see to be erroneous <\s>
<s> a thing can not be at a monopoly value when its supply can be increased to an indefinite extent if we are only willing to incur the cost <\s>
<s> as long as there is any land fit for cultivation which at the existing price can not be profitably cultivated at all there must be some land a little better which will yield the ordinary profit but allow nothing for rent and that land if within the boundary of a farm will be cultivated by the farmer if not so probably by the proprietor or by some other person on sufferance <\s>
<s> some such land at least under cultivation there can scarcely fail to be <\s>
<s> rent therefore forms no part of the cost of production which determines the value of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the land or the capital most unfavorably circumstanced among those actually employed pays no rent and that land or capital determines the cost of production which regulates the value of the whole produce <\s>
