<s> for example wheat is not shipped to england unless the price is lower here than there <\s>
<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>

<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>

<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>
<s> it is not possible that we should produce everything equally well here nor is it possible that england should produce everything equally well <\s>
<s> if we wish to send any goods at all to england we must receive some goods from her <\s>
<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> we continually hear of the disadvantage under which the american producer labors both in foreign markets and even in his own through the lower wages paid by his foreign rivals <\s>
<s> these lower wages we are told enable or are always on the point of enabling them to sell at lower prices and to dislodge the american manufacturer from all markets in which he is not artificially protected <\s>
<s> it will be remembered that as we have before seen international trade in actual practice depends on comparative prices within the same country even though the exporter may not consciously make a comparison <\s>
<s> we send wheat abroad because it is low in price relatively to certain manufactured goods that is we send the wheat but we do not send the manufactured goods <\s>
<s> but so far this is considering only the comparative prices in the same country <\s>
<s> yet we shall fail to realize in actual practice the application of the above principles when we use the terms prices and money if we do not admit that there is in the matter of underselling a comparison also between the absolute price of the goods in one country and the absolute price of the same goods in the competing country <\s>
<s> for example wheat is not shipped to england unless the price is lower here than there <\s>
<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>
<s> it is not possible that we should produce everything equally well here nor is it possible that england should produce everything equally well <\s>
<s> if we wish to send any goods at all to england we must receive some goods from her <\s>
<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>
<s> we do not seem to be in imminent danger of not having goods which we can export in quantities which will buy for us all we may wish to import from abroad <\s>
<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>
<s> if however we learn to use our materials better use machinery with more effect on the quantity produced adapt our industries to our climate get the raw products more cheaply free ourselves from excessive and unreasonable taxation it would be difficult to say what commodities we might not be able eventually to manufacture in competition with the rest of the world <\s>
<s> for we have scarcely ever as a country had the advantage of such conditions to aid us in our foreign trade <\s>
<s> mill now goes on to consider the suggestive fact that wages are higher in england than on the continent and yet that the english have no difficulty in underselling their continental rivals <\s>
<s> before examining this opinion on grounds of principle it is worth while to bestow a moments consideration upon it as a question of fact <\s>
<s> is it true that the wages of manufacturing labor are lower in foreign countries than in england in any sense in which low wages are an advantage to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the artisan of ghent or lyons may earn less wages in a day but does he not do less work <\s>

<s> though wages may be lower on the continent is not the cost of labor which is the real element in the competition very nearly the same <\s>
<s> that it is so seems the opinion of competent judges and is confirmed by the very little difference in the rate of profit between england and the continental countries <\s>
<s> but if so the opinion is absurd that english producers can be undersold by their continental rivals from this cause <\s>
<s> it is only in america that the supposition is prima facie admissible <\s>
<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>
<s> but is it true that low wages even in the sense of low cost of labor enable a country to sell cheaper in the foreign market <\s>

<s> if wages in any of the departments of industry which supply exports are kept artificially or by some accidental cause below the general rate of wages in the country this is a real advantage in the foreign market <\s>
<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>
<s> take for instance the case of the united states in respect to certain commodities <\s>
<s> in that country tobacco and cotton two great articles of export are produced by slave labor while food and manufactures generally are produced by free laborers who either work on their own account or are paid by wages <\s>
<s> in spite of the inferior efficiency of slave labor there can be no reasonable doubt that in a country where the wages of free labor are so high the work executed by slaves is a better bargain to the capitalist <\s>
<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> for example wheat is not shipped to england unless the price is lower here than there <\s>
<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>

<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>
<s> it is not possible that we should produce everything equally well here nor is it possible that england should produce everything equally well <\s>
<s> if we wish to send any goods at all to england we must receive some goods from her <\s>
<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>
<s> we do not seem to be in imminent danger of not having goods which we can export in quantities which will buy for us all we may wish to import from abroad <\s>
<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>
<s> if however we learn to use our materials better use machinery with more effect on the quantity produced adapt our industries to our climate get the raw products more cheaply free ourselves from excessive and unreasonable taxation it would be difficult to say what commodities we might not be able eventually to manufacture in competition with the rest of the world <\s>

<s> before examining this opinion on grounds of principle it is worth while to bestow a moments consideration upon it as a question of fact <\s>
<s> is it true that the wages of manufacturing labor are lower in foreign countries than in england in any sense in which low wages are an advantage to the capitalist <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> for example wheat is not shipped to england unless the price is lower here than there <\s>
<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>

<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>

<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>

<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>

<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>

<s> for example wheat is not shipped to england unless the price is lower here than there <\s>

<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> for example wheat is not shipped to england unless the price is lower here than there <\s>
<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>
<s> it is not possible that we should produce everything equally well here nor is it possible that england should produce everything equally well <\s>
<s> if we wish to send any goods at all to england we must receive some goods from her <\s>
<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>
<s> we do not seem to be in imminent danger of not having goods which we can export in quantities which will buy for us all we may wish to import from abroad <\s>
<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>
<s> if however we learn to use our materials better use machinery with more effect on the quantity produced adapt our industries to our climate get the raw products more cheaply free ourselves from excessive and unreasonable taxation it would be difficult to say what commodities we might not be able eventually to manufacture in competition with the rest of the world <\s>

<s> mill now goes on to consider the suggestive fact that wages are higher in england than on the continent and yet that the english have no difficulty in underselling their continental rivals <\s>
<s> before examining this opinion on grounds of principle it is worth while to bestow a moments consideration upon it as a question of fact <\s>
<s> is it true that the wages of manufacturing labor are lower in foreign countries than in england in any sense in which low wages are an advantage to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the artisan of ghent or lyons may earn less wages in a day but does he not do less work <\s>

<s> though wages may be lower on the continent is not the cost of labor which is the real element in the competition very nearly the same <\s>
<s> that it is so seems the opinion of competent judges and is confirmed by the very little difference in the rate of profit between england and the continental countries <\s>
<s> but if so the opinion is absurd that english producers can be undersold by their continental rivals from this cause <\s>
<s> it is only in america that the supposition is prima facie admissible <\s>
<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>
<s> but is it true that low wages even in the sense of low cost of labor enable a country to sell cheaper in the foreign market <\s>

<s> if wages in any of the departments of industry which supply exports are kept artificially or by some accidental cause below the general rate of wages in the country this is a real advantage in the foreign market <\s>
<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>
<s> take for instance the case of the united states in respect to certain commodities <\s>
<s> in that country tobacco and cotton two great articles of export are produced by slave labor while food and manufactures generally are produced by free laborers who either work on their own account or are paid by wages <\s>
<s> in spite of the inferior efficiency of slave labor there can be no reasonable doubt that in a country where the wages of free labor are so high the work executed by slaves is a better bargain to the capitalist <\s>
<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>

<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>

<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>

<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>

<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>

<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>

<s> if india or morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close competition with the united states and the price were to fall in london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the international exchange <\s>
<s> in the illustration already used we must for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> the fall in the price of wheat without any change in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen or twenty bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> if the price went so low as to require twenty one bushels to pay for ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as compared with the price in london would be an indication of the fact <\s>
<s> so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is merely a register of the terms at which our international exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the international trade <\s>
<s> if the price falls so low in a foreign market that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual reward for capital in other competing industries that is the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> in exporting wheat from the united states the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the united states <\s>
<s> now the price if it stands for the value which is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is the sum out of which wages and profits are paid <\s>
<s> if the price were to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of profit also <\s>
<s> then we should probably hear of complaints by the shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and of a falling off in the trade <\s>
<s> in other words as the capitalist is the one who manages the operation and is the one first affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising from competition generally shows itself first in lessened profits <\s>
<s> the price then is the means by which we determine whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage which will insure a gain from international trade <\s>
<s> an exportable article whose price in this country is lowsince it is for this reason selected as an exportis one whose cost is low <\s>
<s> if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in this than in other industries <\s>
<s> and yet it is precisely in the most productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and are paid <\s>
<s> although each article is sold at a low price the great quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large <\s>
<s> that is the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current in this country <\s>
<s> consequently although wages and profits may be very high relatively to older countries in those industries of the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact of this low cost and consequently this low price where competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for exportation <\s>
<s> we are therefore inevitably led to a position in which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together in an exportable commodity <\s>
<s> in practice certainly the high wages do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price with english prices from sending goods abroadbecause we send goods abroad from our most productive employments <\s>
<s> as an illustration of this principle it is found that the leading exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood <\s>
<s> but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices here and prices in england for example in order to determine whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so dear <\s>
<s> it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured goods <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in which we have a less advantage <\s>
<s> if the majority of occupations are so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated industriesnot being so productive as others either from lack of skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation    can not pay the usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at home <\s>
<s> for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of which the usual high wages and profits can be paid <\s>
<s> the less productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is the high rate of profits as well as the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents selling abroad <\s>
<s> it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it is just as much high profits <\s>
<s> of course if the less productive industries wish to compete with england and if they payas we know they mustthe high rate of wages due to the general productiveness of our countrys industries they must submit to less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire <\s>
<s> it is not possible that we should produce everything equally well here nor is it possible that england should produce everything equally well <\s>
<s> if we wish to send any goods at all to england we must receive some goods from her <\s>
<s> in order to get the gain arising from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist <\s>
<s> it is not however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any and all foreign trade <\s>
<s> our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be hoped that they may long continue high <\s>
<s> we do not seem to be in imminent danger of not having goods which we can export in quantities which will buy for us all we may wish to import from abroad <\s>
<s> xiii and note the vast increase of exports at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well with any competitor in the world everything that is made <\s>
<s> if as was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor 289 we must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages do not prevent us to day from having an hitherto unequaled export trade <\s>
<s> even if all wages and all profits were lower it would however affect all industries alike and some would still be more productive relatively to others and the same inequality would remain <\s>
<s> if however we learn to use our materials better use machinery with more effect on the quantity produced adapt our industries to our climate get the raw products more cheaply free ourselves from excessive and unreasonable taxation it would be difficult to say what commodities we might not be able eventually to manufacture in competition with the rest of the world <\s>
<s> for we have scarcely ever as a country had the advantage of such conditions to aid us in our foreign trade <\s>
<s> mill now goes on to consider the suggestive fact that wages are higher in england than on the continent and yet that the english have no difficulty in underselling their continental rivals <\s>
<s> before examining this opinion on grounds of principle it is worth while to bestow a moments consideration upon it as a question of fact <\s>
<s> is it true that the wages of manufacturing labor are lower in foreign countries than in england in any sense in which low wages are an advantage to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the artisan of ghent or lyons may earn less wages in a day but does he not do less work <\s>
<s> degrees of efficiency considered does his labor cost less to his employer <\s>
<s> though wages may be lower on the continent is not the cost of labor which is the real element in the competition very nearly the same <\s>
<s> that it is so seems the opinion of competent judges and is confirmed by the very little difference in the rate of profit between england and the continental countries <\s>
<s> but if so the opinion is absurd that english producers can be undersold by their continental rivals from this cause <\s>
<s> it is only in america that the supposition is prima facie admissible <\s>
<s> in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so greatits efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaserthat the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher <\s>
<s> low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry <\s>
<s> but is it true that low wages even in the sense of low cost of labor enable a country to sell cheaper in the foreign market <\s>
<s> i mean of course low wages which are common to the whole productive industry of the country <\s>
<s> if wages in any of the departments of industry which supply exports are kept artificially or by some accidental cause below the general rate of wages in the country this is a real advantage in the foreign market <\s>
<s> it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor <\s>
<s> take for instance the case of the united states in respect to certain commodities <\s>
<s> in that country tobacco and cotton two great articles of export are produced by slave labor while food and manufactures generally are produced by free laborers who either work on their own account or are paid by wages <\s>
<s> in spite of the inferior efficiency of slave labor there can be no reasonable doubt that in a country where the wages of free labor are so high the work executed by slaves is a better bargain to the capitalist <\s>
<s> to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor <\s>
<s> if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave grown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price <\s>
<s> their cheapness is partly an artificial cheapness which may be compared to that produced by a bounty on production or on exportation or considering the means by which it is obtained an apter comparison would be with the cheapness of stolen goods <\s>
<s> illustration chart xv chart xv <\s>
<s> mill was in error may be seen by chart no <\s>
<s> xv which shows the enormous increase of cotton production under the r  gime of free labor as compared with that of slave labor in the united states <\s>
<s> the abolition of slavery has been an economic gain to the south <\s>
<s> moreover the exports of raw cotton have increased from 644,327 921 pounds in 1869 to 2,288 075,062 pounds in 1883 while for corresponding years the exports of tobacco increased from 181,527 630 to 235,628 360 pounds <\s>
<s> in other words exports of tobacco were increased by 30 per cent and those of raw cotton by no less than 255 per cent <\s>
<s> besides the prices of cotton and tobacco are no higher now than before 1850 <\s>
<s> an advantage of a similar economical though of a very different moral character is that possessed by domestic manufactures fabrics produced in the leisure hours of families partially occupied in other pursuits who not depending for subsistence on the produce of the manufacture can afford to sell it at any price however low for which they think it worth while to take the trouble of producing <\s>
<s> the workman of zrich is to day a manufacturer to morrow again an agriculturist and changes his occupations with the seasons in a continual round <\s>
<s> manufacturing industry and tillage advance hand in hand in inseparable alliance and in this union of the two occupations the secret may be found why the simple and unlearned swiss manufacturer can always go on competing and increasing in prosperity in the face of those extensive establishments fitted out with great economic and what is still more important intellectual resources <\s>
<s> in the case of these domestic manufactures the comparative cost of production on which the interchange between countries depends is much lower than in proportion to the quantity of labor employed <\s>
<s> the work people looking to the earnings of their loom for a part only if for any part of their actual maintenance can afford to work for a less remuneration than the lowest rate of wages which can permanently exist in the employments by which the laborer has to support the whole expense of a family <\s>
<s> working as they do not for an employer but for themselves they may be said to carry on the manufacture at no cost at all except the small expense of a loom and of the material and the limit of possible cheapness is not the necessity of living by their trade but that of earning enough by the work to make that social employment of their leisure hours not disagreeable <\s>
<s>    but not when common to all <\s>
<s> these two cases of slave labor and of domestic manufactures exemplify the conditions under which low wages enable a country to sell its commodities cheaper in foreign markets and consequently to undersell its rivals or to avoid being undersold by them <\s>
<s> but no such advantage is conferred by low wages when common to all branches of industry <\s>
<s> general low wages never caused any country to undersell its rivals nor did general high wages ever hinder it from doing so <\s>
<s> to demonstrate this we must turn to an elementary principle which was discussed in a former chapter 290 general low wages do not cause low prices nor high wages high prices within the country itself <\s>
<s> general prices are not raised by a rise of wages any more than they would be raised by an increase of the quantity of labor required in all production <\s>
<s> expenses which affect all commodities equally have no influence on prices <\s>
<s> if the maker of broadcloth or cutlery and nobody else had to pay higher wages the price of his commodity would rise just as it would if he had to employ more labor because otherwise he would gain less profit than other producers and nobody would engage in the employment <\s>
<s> but if everybody has to pay higher wages or everybody to employ more labor the loss must be submitted to as it affects everybody alike no one can hope to get rid of it by a change of employment each therefore resigns himself to a diminution of profits and prices remain as they were <\s>
<s> in like manner general low wages or a general increase in the productiveness of labor does not make prices low but profits high <\s>
<s> if wages fall meaning here by wages the cost of labor why on that account should the producer lower his price <\s>
<s> he will be forced it may be said by the competition of other capitalists who will crowd into his employment <\s>
