<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>
<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>

<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
<s> the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally <\s>

<s> however without there being any change in the productiveness of any industry if the price of the article should rise for instance from an increased demand that would make the total value arising from the products of the industry larger in its purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided among labor and capital <\s>
<s> if there be free competition more capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger profits and so wages would rise <\s>
<s> therefore it is possible that high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and effect <\s>
<s> in fact the change in price generally precedes the change in wages <\s>
<s> on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great value of the total product 291 since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price <\s>
<s> it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer <\s>
<s> but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cotton spinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists <\s>
<s> these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit <\s>
<s> this high profit the cotton spinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit <\s>
<s> it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in <\s>
<s> countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business <\s>
<s> but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless <\s>
<s> low profits as affecting the carrying trade <\s>
<s> it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carrying trade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another <\s>
<s> such were venice and the hanse towns <\s>
<s> when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight <\s>
<s> at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws <\s>
<s> the carrying trade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital <\s>
<s> the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carrying trade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws 292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose <\s>
<s> in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the medival statutes of england and the continent which still remain on the statute book <\s>
<s> they do not permit an american to buy a vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous duties a provision which is intended to foster ship building in the united states <\s>
<s> even with this legislation ships as a fact are not built here for the foreign trade and our ship builders practically supply the coasting trade only which is not open to foreigners <\s>
<s> the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the demand for    free ships    this however has to do with ship building <\s>
<s> but ship owning or ship sailing is quite distinct from it <\s>
<s> the ability to get as great a return from capital and labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to americans is another thing <\s>
<s> even if we had    free ships    the higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a less for a more productive business <\s>
<s> in 1884 congress has very properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which diminished the returns from ship sailing and it remains to be seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign carrying trade <\s>
<s> at present we have a very small tonnage even in that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods <\s>
<s> of distribution as affected by exchange <\s>
<s> exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages <\s>
<s> the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws <\s>
<s> it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles <\s>
<s> the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shareswages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land <\s>
<s> if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities <\s>
<s> it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or non existence of exchange or money <\s>
<s> wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a countrys industries ]; and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence <\s>
<s> as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication <\s>
<s> what is here meant however by wages is the laborers real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver <\s>
<s> in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles <\s>
<s> wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborers comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind <\s>
<s> wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained <\s>
<s> if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same <\s>
<s> the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles <\s>
<s> in all old countriesall countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistencethe habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase <\s>
<s> their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise <\s>
<s> of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else <\s>
<s> it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part <\s>
<s> the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter <\s>
<s> it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes <\s>
<s> the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole <\s>
<s> in any given state therefore of the laborers    habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progressin its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile <\s>
<s> now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counter force which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns <\s>
<s> the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other <\s>
<s> it will be noted in this exposition that mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view an old country with a population so dense that numbers are always pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life <\s>
<s> that these are not the economic conditions in the united states goes without saying <\s>
<s> first of all the margin of cultivation is high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large <\s>
<s> high wages are found together with low prices of food <\s>
<s> the existing population is not so numerous as to require for the cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of fertility <\s>
<s> the ability to command a high reward for labor as compared with european industries owing to the general prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers <\s>
<s> the standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection between the increase of population here and the price of food for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost of producing food would require checks upon population <\s>
<s> there is a considerable margin above necessaries in the laborers real wages in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and amusements <\s>
<s> in the law of rent <\s>
<s> the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise <\s>
<s> the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords <\s>
<s> exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally 293 found it <\s>
<s> rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable <\s>
<s>    nor in the law of profits <\s>
<s> wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise <\s>
<s> for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits <\s>
<s> we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls <\s>
<s> let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law <\s>
<s> there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased <\s>
<s> the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kindreal wagesmay rise <\s>
<s> or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborers consumption <\s>
<s> on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall <\s>
<s> if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit <\s>
<s> but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher <\s>
<s> the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist <\s>
<s> there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off <\s>
<s> it may be saidit used formerly to be saidthat he will get rid of it by raising his price <\s>
<s> but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted 294 the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed self contradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility <\s>
<s> this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices <\s>
<s> a rise of general wages falls on profits <\s>
<s> there is no possible alternative <\s>
<s> having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborers obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill <\s>
<s> the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production <\s>
<s> the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage <\s>
<s> he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before <\s>
<s> for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce <\s>
<s> but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated <\s>
<s> he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages <\s>
<s> this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price <\s>
<s> the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified <\s>
<s> it will be paid wholly from profits <\s>
<s> thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits <\s>
<s> but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already <\s>
